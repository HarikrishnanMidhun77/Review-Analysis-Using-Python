Phone is working on, I was planning to use it for whatsapp anyway
 The oh problem, I can't change the idiom
excellent product in perfect condition

I like these phone I bought it for my mom and she loves it
It came with arabian keyboard :(
I love the phone, but one problem and one problem only











once the mic goes that's it
 No more mic
 But it can take a beating

I love it

Very practical and user-friendly phone
 I am very satisfied with it

Sharp and classy phone
very good
100% gooddd

Shipped quickly and was exactly what I expected

Works wonderful for the price

Bought this as an alternative to a smart phone and data plan
 I use it with Go-Phone on a pay-as-you-go plan
 The phone functions are great
 The radio and music players are very good sound quality
 The smart phone type features are easier and faster to use than any smart phone I have used
 There are some software glitches that are documented on the Nokia support site which proved easily fixed
 Even though many of the Nokia based features are no longer supported by Microsoft, you can still use the features needed by accessing the web directly via WIFI connection - or data if you want to pay for the privilege - and launching the site/application from there
 Although the new Nokia browser is pretty Spartan in appearance, it is fast and runs with good stability
 I am a very big guy with lands large even for my size and I find the full qwerty keyboard to be pretty easy to use
 I like the programmable hot keys and on-screen shortcuts
 Keeps you from launching items that require data connections by accident
 The back lighting is thorough and even and the raised buttons are tactile with a positive click response
 The phone does have a few quirks
 There is no airplane mode as far as I can tell
 The flight profile doesn't seem to be able to be set with the broadcasting and receiving functions turned off
 The main navigation button/mouse is a little small and doesn't always respond as expected - that might be me though
 All in all I would recommend this phone and vendor highly if you want the features of a smart phone but you don't need GPS or a big data bill every month for a bunch of things you don't need or want to keep you life running smoothly

muy buen producto
This phone is trapped in 2001, if you want a simple phone get an old school flip phone
 If you want something also for work get a blackberry or somthing new
 This isn't even in the middle of those two, it's in another dimension
 Nothing but frustration with this phone

Excellent
A friend mentioned this phone to me and it worth what he said
 Thanks a lot my friend

Used this unlocked GSM Nokia Asha 302 in the Philippines just recently (Jan-Feb 2015)
 Excellent, no problem with functionality
 Bought a P40 SIM card at the airport & presto
 It worked
 I passed it on to my brother the instant I came back to the US
 He will be visiting the Philippines soon
 It was very easy to use
 Having been used to smart phones w/ touch screen, I surprised myself when I worked w/ it easily not having read the instructions to operate it
 I'll buy another one like this & definitely an upgraded version of this Nokia unlocked GSM phone

Excelente
Excellent phone for my youngest son, with walk in reasonable options, and quality first
Excelente
solid phone
Good choice
perfect, practical, easy to handle, good resolution, well packed
excellent product 





all right

Nokia is the brand that can be used in telephone, good price, excellent team, was a gift to my daughter and she liked it, easy to use and very affordable price, I recommend it

First off, let me say I've been a Nokia user since I had my first cell phone at age 16, ten years ago
 Of course there was that one year where I ventured off into Samsung land but that phone died and back to Nokia I went
 But I've always enjoyed Nokia phones
Second, I've been looking for a QWERTY phone with internet/video/mp3 playing capabilities and the Asha 302 fits it
 It is a strong build, as I have dropped it numerous times and the phone is still intact
 I like the keyboard as I am not a fan of touchscreens at all (which is why I didn't get the Asha 303)
 As far as sound I think it depends on your headphones
 I had earbuds that produced a loudness of 93 decibels which made the listening experience mediocre but then I bought buds with a 110 db loudness and the sound is much better
 Nokia Xpress is a bit sucky but I downloaded an Opera browser for the phone and it works slightly better so internet experience is pretty easy
 I won't get into video games and SNS because I don't even do that on my PC so I don't have a reason to use it on my phone
My only wish is that the 302 had a built in antenna so I could listen to re radio without RDS earbuds
 Other than that, it's a really great phone and for those who want to move up into Blackberrys but don't want to pay so much the Nokia Asha 302 is a great phone to start with
EDIT (October 3, 2013): I found a Gino 25cm 4 Section Telescoping Stainless Steel AM FM Radio Antenna 3
5mm Plug to use for playing the radio through the speaker
 So now I'm really enjoying the phone for when I'm sitting outside with friends or at my desk

Nokia Asha 302 Unlocked GSM Phone with 3
2MP Camera, Video, QWERTYDependableTraditional Nokia Menu'sNot Complicated like 'Smart Phones'DurableEasy to use on Straighttalk, Internet, WiFi, Bluetooth

This is a solidly-built unlocked phone that is an update to the popular Nokia C3
 It runs the S40 software which has its goods and bads
 It has good reception and nice audio
 The 3g supports 850 and 1900 bands (AT&T and T-mobile when it's hspa is refarmed from 1700/2100 to the 1900 pcs band
) + the 2100 band
The keyboard is pretty good, not as firm as other Nokia qwerty phones (e
g
 E5), but comparable to the C3 keyboard
 The one that I have is obviously for the world market, since it has some added European chars and symbols on the keypad
 Wi-fi works fine, and Opera Mini installed and runs without problems - good way to go for a bit of web-surfing
 I did not tried any of the e-mail or social clients
 Text messaging can be set to 'normal' in-box or conversation modes
 OVI store app does not seem to work that well
 There are a couple of features that I found appealing: ability to backup the phone memory to the sd card; ability to lock the keypad with a passcode either manually or automatically after a set time
 The battery is fairly good sized (BL-5J)
 The 'function' keys and the d-pad keys can all be re-assigned to user defined short-cuts
 My opinion: it is a worthy update (3g) to the C3, not quite in the same league as the more expensive E5 which has the multi-tasking S60 software
 For the price of around $110, it is an unlocked feature (gsm/3g) phone well worth considering, as long as one knows that one is getting a non-smart phone and that apps for S40 is very limited

Hola, compramos dos teléfonos y vienieron totalente diferentes, uno vino con la batería dañada, se descarga de inmediato
 El otro teléfono vino sin la tarjeta de memoria y los teclados y cargadores son muy distintos
Mi Tía y yo nos sentimos engañadas y defraudadas :(
THIS CELLPHONE IS VERY EASY FOR USING, IT HAS COMPLETE APPS FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE, MOST OF THEM ARE INCORPORATED AND I JUST HAD TO USE IT WITH WI FI CONNECTION, I AM SATISFIED WITH THIS PURCHASED IT IS A SIMPLE PHONE BUT COMPLETE AND IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT



GRACIAS ME LLEGO EL PROCTO QUE COMPRE Y LLEVO EN EL MOMENTO INDICADO Y EN UN BUEN ENVALAJE LO RECOMIENDO SASTIFACTORIAMENTE


Freezes alot
 But i bought primarily for playing back my music instead of my BB
 Its a great phone for SMS and rings really loud
 The body is strong and neat
The keys are a little hard to hit, and I didn't expect a Spanish keyboard
 But overall, a very good phone

Preface: This is not what would be considered a smartphone in the United States (Nothing on the par of Android, iPhone, or Windows Phone), it is basically a feature phone
 Also, although it says here that it has a US warranty all of the warranty material it came with referenced Latin American countries so I am not sure if it is really covered under a US Warranty
 I returned it during Amazon's return window so it wasn't an issue
 Now for the phone review
Pros: The phone has a great keyboard
 If you are familiar with the E-series phones its that type of keyboard
 The interface is some sort of modified Symbian and I liked it in a lot of ways
 The style of the hardware is attractive and the Gray is a nice color
 The camera was pretty decent considering it is only 2 megapixels
 For e-mail it's adequate
Cons: I'll start with the small issues and work up to the big problem that ultimately made me decide to return the phone
 The onboard social network apps are not fully functional
 You can update your Facebook or Twitter status but the rest of it is so-so
 The Ovi store in general is a poor app store, but this phone isn't able to use many of them
 Even the old Facebook app that I used on my old E71 (It used to be called Snaptu but Facebook has since renamed it to Facebook for Everyone) is incompatible with this phone as are most of the better apps in the Ovi store
 The browser was mediocre, barely passable
 Also, NO GPS for this phone
 Nokia/Ovi Maps is incompatible which is too bad because that has always been a Nokia strength
 That immediately eliminates this phone as a smart phone
 With all of that said, I bought this phone for my wife and she really only needed a phone for texts and calls so we could have overlooked these things
 The problem we could not overlook was the very shabby, flimsy piece of metal that was supposed to hold in place the standard sim card
 This little piece of metal was barely attached to the phone and would not lock into place to hold down the sim card
 Because the sim card would intermittently get lose inside the phone and constantly lose the signal
 So we would have to take the battery out and re-adjust the sim card
 Then it would work for a little while only to ultimately have to repeat the process
 It was WAY more frustration than it was worth
 It's too bad because as a basic phone for calls, texts, e-mail, and occasionally updating your Facebook/Twitter status; this phone has a lot of potential
 Becuase of the problem with the sim card holder, however, it was essentially unusable
 I have used Nokia phones for years (I use a Lumia 710 personally) and I am really surprised Nokia would do such a sloppy job on something as important as the part that holds the sim card in place
 What a waste

We just received the phone a few days ago
 Put in the Consumer Cellular SIM card, and it is ready to go
 The phone seems very nice even though we have not come close to discovering all of the things it will do
 It has a large number of ring tones built in

I bought this phone as a Christmas present for myself because I wanted something a bit more advanced than the Nokia C2 I purchased from Amazon in 2012, but didn't want to go all the way with a smartphone
 In other words, a good feature phone with smartphone features without the touch screen
 Red, however, is my favorite color, but I went for the white one because my C2 is silver and I couldn't find a silver Asha 302 on Amazon
 I've had it for a week and it works great
 Best is the Wi-Fi feature, which gives you access to the Web without purchasing a data plan (which I may have to do if I want to access personal email or go on Facebook)
 It has the great calendar, alarm clock, text messaging, camera, missed/received call and other features of the C2, which makes it a keeper
 And it's a little bigger, with a wider screen, but not so big it can't fit into my pocket or purse
 I can use the same Nokia charger I had for the C2
 Now all I have to do is await the arrival of my purple phone skin, then I'll be all right
 I've had Nokia phones since 1999 and they've never let me down - just get better

The Phone is pretty good
 I am using it with a LycaMobile plan
 Only thing that is awkward is that the bottom row of letters is off compared to other phones and devices
 Before this I had been using a blackberry
 When trying to type on the nokia I am always mistyping Ms, Ns and espectially the shift key (which you need to hit to insert any punctuation)
loved everything about it
 also it looks like any other touch phone but is not
 which makes it stylish yet classic

THIS IS A SOLUTION IF YOU WANT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ECONOMIC AND NOT VERY SOPHISTICATED
 YOUR PRICE IS A GOOD CHOICE FOR THE PRODUCT THAT RECEIVE
rECOMMEND IT
This phone in an excellent phone at a great price
 I was impressed with the features of this phone and would recommend this to anyone

Have problems setting correct time on Nokia Asha 302
 Customer support on Nokia
com does not accept inquiry about Asha 302 phones
 Is this product obsolete, or is Nokia customer support poor
 Booklet that came with phone is also poorly written

This is a good phone although it seems to have a small screen
 However, it's capable of performing all the basic functions such as calling, messaging, web browsing, social networking and it also has a wi-fi capability

I've been a long time user of the iPhone
 I finally got sick of it and sold it
 I just wanted a simple phone
 After going through about 3 of them, this fits the bill very well
 The texting interface is very nice and intuitive
 The battery life is stellar
 It connects to the internet just fine
 I can check my email in case of emergency, look up directions, etc
 Basically everything I was able to do with my smartphone, without the bells and whistles
 Having a physical keyboard is quite nice too
 The OS seems very stable and snappy
 You have things like calendar, todo, memos, etc
Backup is a snap
 Just insert an SD card and go to Settings to back it up
 No more iTunes
 If you want to add music or podcasts, just plug it into the computer, copy paste to the SD card and you're done
I would buy this phone again definitely if I broke or lost it

This phone, like all of Nokia's feature phones, are great for their value and durability
 The last phone I had before buying this one was a Nokia C-3, which was also a great phone
 It lasted for years, and probably would have kept going if I hadn't accidentally jumped into a pool with it in my pocket :P This phone is basically an update of the C-3
 It is sleek and small, has a full QWERTY keyboard, and has Wi-Fi internet browsing
 This is the best phone you can get if you're looking for functionality, but don't want to throw hundreds of dollars at a smartphone with a data plan
And the buyer should be aware; this is NOT a smartphone
 If you're looking for anything like a smartphone, you will be disappointed
 If you're looking for a toy you can take out of your pocket every couple of minutes to tinker around with, you will be disappointed
 Yes, it does have an internet browser which works well, but the screen is quite small so it's not good for recreational browsing
 I just use it to look things up, it works fine for that
 It also has some social network apps, but I don't use them
 I don't know how well they work, but if that's a priority for you this phone probably isn't the best choice
 Same goes for the camera; I don't use it, can't speak to its quality, but if a camera is important to you this isn't the best choice
The only other potential negative I can see in this phone is that the keys really are pretty small
 I haven't had an issue with them personally, but if someone has big hands I see how this could be annoying
I bought this phone for the advantages to NOT owning a smartphone: longer battery life, higher durability, lower cost, but still good at accomplishing what it needs to
 If you're looking for the same thing, Nokia is definitely the best way to go

Love it

Sorry it took so long to Reply or Review this purchase as it over 18 months
This Phone was a Clone Phone from Hong Kong--The quality is Fair--ALL THE SYMBOLS DON'T MATCH--such as \ 
--But the phone works I think amazon should Boycott this Seller

Bought it as a gift for my Mum and she loves it
 It is a strong durable phone, has good reception and it functions well

Incredible
 This phone does not have Splaniish Language, I dont understand how can it be a international version, lost money

BAD
good
The battery died in less than 24/hours




Excellent Product

very well
Cannot connect to GSM network
This cell phone exceeded my expectations, it's user friendly & everything works like they said it would
 The price is amazingly cheap
 The features are enormous & helpful

pros

 it works fine, its easy to use, not too heavy
cons 

 most of the apps are for android iphone and bb
I went through lots of reviews for different phone before buying it
 I found this phone pretty good
 No problems so far

excelente
I have to say that it is a ok phone
 I don't like the keyboard
 There is only 5 or 6 language options, no Korean and Chinese

excelente
Phone works great, looks great and shipped quiet quickly only issue is can with a European Charger so had to purchase micro-usb to usb cable to charge phone which I would have had to do to download and update system any way

Ver Good

a pretty capable, durable texting phone, unlocked as advertised, but the version i received had arabic on the keys in addition to the typical ISO basic latin and many symbols missing, like "
"

Excellent phone has all the special functions to be communicated with all social networks, excellent operational


I recommend it 100% excellent product
Do not buy it

 It feels like a pretended toy in your hand
 If you want it for your kids, it's ok


Excellent phone, for adults recommend
 WhatsApp, Internet , app, radio, keyboard qwerty easy for use
 Display big visualiser
 Funny
I have enjoyed my Nokia C3 phone for a few years, but it was tired and needed an update
 This Asha 302 phone is just that - all of the Symbian S40 simple goodness, with a much higher quality set of hardware
 The screen is sharper, processor faster, phone takes nice clear pictures that are pretty much good enough, the ring and alert tones are more discreet and professional
 The internet and mail stuff is actually useable on T-Mobile's 3
5G network and requires very little data to stay connected on a minumal plan
 Strangely, I cannot it do wifi yet 


 it receives the signal but just insists on using network data or nothing at all
 Probably a setting in the menu I have not toggled to the right setting
 Anyway - if you want a phone that texts very easily, has a 4-day battery, a very convenient and useable features, and yet not crack open the crack-pipe of the internet constanly, the Asha 302 does it with style and then some
 I may get myself another one or two for the future, as I bet this is the end-run for this type of practical phone

Phone was not new, it was not unlocked and battery doesn't work

Es un celular de gama baja que hace su trabajo dando además algunas características propias de los smartphones
 Se recomienda para personas que quieran un celular para hacer o recibir llamadas pero que también quieran algo de comunicación a través de otros medios como el WhatsApp, Twitter o Facebook
It's a low-end cell does its job well giving some characteristics of smartphones
 Recommended for people who want a phone to make or receive calls but also want some communication through other media such as WhatsApp, Twitter or Facebook

THIS PHONE WAS WELL WORTH THE MONEY I PAID FOR IT FROM AMAZON WHAREHOUSE THEY R # 1 IN MY BOOK FOR A UNLOCKED USED CELL PHONE THIS CELL PHONE WAS IN MINT CONDITION 


 AND THE KEYBOARD WAS BEAUTIFUL 

 U MUST SEE TO BELIEVE I HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY WITH MY CELL PHONE AND IT LOOKS BRAN NEW

 I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS CELL PHONE USED AND UNLOCKED TO BUY USED


 ESPECIALLY THIS NOKIA IT'S REALLY A NICE LOOKING CELL PHONE 

 SAVE YOUR MONEY BUY THIS CELL U WILL NOT GO WRONG WITH NOKIA


 KC KEEP 
 UP THE GOOD WORK NOKIA

SIN DUDA UNA GRAN INVERSION

I really wanted to love this phone
 I loved the windows 8
1 home screen with live tiles and Cortana was excellent
 The phone itself was built pretty solid
 However, the cons far outweigh the pros
 I had to do a hard reset on this phone THREE TIMES within the span of two weeks
 First, it would not connect to wifi
 Secondly, it kept rebooting itself (one day, it rebooted itself TEN TIMES
) Lastly, the phone was frozen in time one morning
 The phone eventually shut off one day and would never turn back on
 The phone completely died on me
 I don't know if this was a software problem or if it was the phone itself, but I am so disappointed and will never buy a Windows phone again

I love this phone
 I gave up my Nokia Lumia 1520 because I had to switch back to Sprint and its antenna doesn't work for Sprint
 I got an LG G3 which I'm very happy with
 But then I missed the Windows phone OS
 I missed Cortana, the live tiles, the here maps, the am/fm radio, the rolodex style app list and contacts list and the dedicated camera button
 So, I bought this Lumia 625 from this seller
 To my pleasant surprise, it came with an orange housing as well
 I thought I was only getting a white phone
 I was able to update it to WP 8
1, not too easily but after trying for 4-5 times, I got it
 I bought a prepaid sim card from AT&T and loaded it up with a $25 monthly charge
 The camera isn't so good but that's the only thing negative about this phone
 I also missed the 4
7 inch screen that I had with my Galaxy S3 before switching to the 1520 then to G3

Great phone I was really happy with it except I couldn't get more then 2g on metro or T-Mobile I want to return it but I don't know how
Hi I would like to inform you that the cell has damaged the flash does not work in or on any of the options either in automatic mode
Satisfied
 Love windows phone, working good, no issues
The phone asked ejecutarce update and after it no longer wanted the phone card Acepar any operator

This phone is absolutely fantastic for the price, but some potential buyers may not be fully aware of what to expect when it arrives
First off this phone is actually an unlocked AT&T Lumia 900, so there will be AT&T branding on the front
 This means that the original packaging will already be opened, as the seller needs to manually unlock the phone before they ship it to you
 This does NOT mean that it is a used phone
 In order to be able to use non-AT&T sim cards, it is necessary for the seller to contact AT&T to receive an unlock code that frees it from the AT&T network
 In my order, there was hardly any sign that it was handled at all, except for maybe a little finger print on the front glass
 All the essential documents from AT&T and Nokia were inside the box, as well as a SIM ejector tool and a power cable
As is stated in the description, this phone will work on any HSPA/WCDMA 850/900/1900/2100 MHz/Quad-band data network and any GSM/GPRS/EDGE: 850/900/1800/1900 MHz cellular network, which in turn opens it for carriers in Europe and some in Asia
 For US providers, there are currently only 2 major carriers that have GSM networks: AT&T and T-Mobile
 There are other smaller carriers that offer services, but they utilize AT&T and T-Mobile towers in their coverage
 These carriers include Straight Talk, Red Pocket Mobile, i Wireless, etc
, and offer really affordable prepaid plans that I myself utilize
 T-Mobile also offers a $30 a month prepaid plan that is rather reasonable
Unfortunately this phone will not work on any CDMA networks, which rules out Verizon, Sprint and US Cellular
 For more information on the differences between CDMA and GSM networks, PCMAG
com has a fairly easy to read article explaining the differences between the two
Now onto the phone itself
 I must say that I love this phone
 It has a fairly decent Amoled 4
3 inch display, with a resolution of only 800x480
 In our modern age of 1280×720 and above screens that may seem rather paltry
 While using the phone normally it is looks as good as any other screen, but when watching YouTube videos it's lack of pixels becomes apparent
 For me I use my iPad and laptop for watching videos so it doesn't matter to me all that much, but for others it may be a deal breaker
The build of the phone is absolutely fantastic
 It is made of a solid polycarbonate body that is very resistant to scratches, with a screen made of Corning Gorilla Glass
 Needless to say, it is very sturdy
 The screen also seems to attract a large number of fingerprints as well, and for some reason is not all that easy to clean off
 There is even a YouTube video where a hammer, saw and nail are taken to it and it comes up with little or no damage
 The only thing on the phone that seems to be somewhat damageable is the metal piece around the camera lens
 After less than 24 hours, there were already little scratches visible
 For me I don't really care too much about it, but for others it may be really irritating
The camera itself is 8 megapixels with a Carl Zeiss lens, and it is just ok
 There are certainly better phone cameras out there, with the iPhone 5 and Lumia 920 blowing it out of the water
 For me it works best outdoors, as indoor shots tend to have more noise for whatever reason
This phone uses Windows Phone 7
5 Mango, so it is not the brand new Windows Phone 8
 Sad thing about this phone is that it will never receive an update to Windows Phone 8
 The hardware is just unable to fully handle the new OS
 Instead it will receive Windows Phone 7
8, which gives it some Windows Phone 8 functionality, such as resizable tiles and the like
 But apps in the future will cater just to Windows Phone 8, meaning that those with 7
8 and below will be left out in the cold with newer apps
 Again, this isn't a deal breaker for me but for many it will be
One of the things that attracted me to this phone is Nokia Drive
 Unlike most smartphone map applications, it does not require data in order to run
 Before you set out on a trip you download fully detailed maps onto your phone, and then the built in GPS chip is used to map your location on the map
 You can even download state or country specific maps, so you save space by not downloading the entire US map pack
 All of this is done without data usage, which is great if you are traveling abroad
 Oh, and it is completely free of charge
 For travelers like myself, this is an awesome feature
 I am also a student, so having a mobile version of Microsoft Office in my pocket is absolutely wonderful, for it allows me to edit documents while on the go
Overall this is a fantastic phone but definitely shows its age (close to one year)
 However, its awesome build quality as well as fantastic applications for travelers made it a must have for me
 It fits my needs well, but potential buyers will need to consider whether it will work well for them

i like it it is very nice 
very well
a good gift to my friend
it is really very good
the item is nice

Just got this phone and all I can say is that it is amazing
 People say the camera is one of the weak points
 That may be true but I adjusted the settings to 200 for the ISO and 1 for the exposure and the pictures have improved greatly
 The simplicity of this phone makes it easy to learn and pick up for anyone
 Its a breeze finding things on this phone, no lag, great UI
 The live tiles are easy to use and multi-task through
 And this phone is blazing fast
 enough said

Good phone, excellent price
 The only problem is the internet sharing because is blocked by AT&T
RECOMMENDED SELLER EXCELLENT PRODUCT
does it work in asia

Phone is nice but it is not factory unlocked and I have a lot of problems to have data connection stable in ArgentIna, sometimes work, sometimes do not, then great for who have not a data plan and use wifi but if you one all benefits of the phone take care 






Bougth this phone for many reasons especially to play the radio
 My friend likes it and would recommend to all

Unlike the first phone that had all the accessories, this one only the wall charger, and even the phone seem to had been opened and a tissue stock at the place you need to charge
 It is a returned phone from AT&T Unlocked not Factory

very easy to use, all the basic things i needed on a simple but trendy touchscreen phone is in this one

FAST SHIPPING , GOOD PRODUCT, THE ONLY THINGS SELLER MENTIONED FACTORY UNLOCK BUT IN RECEIVED AT & t version but without any problem
 so far every things is OK
i am very exact and sensitive about cell phone but so far this product was OK


 if somethings bad happened i will update the review
Great phone, excellent price
 One of the best smartphone right now
The only problem is the internet sharing because is blocked by AT&T
this phone is great


 i would recommend it as its a real change from the saturated market of android and iphone
so nice
Great phone, works well
 Delivery was fast
 I only wish Windows had more of the common apps available

I prefer the lumia 950 XL materials, but the phone its ok
 Works very well and you can use almost two day with the battery

best phone and good service by "buyerush" and "amazon"
 its a must buy phone

Excelente
If you need your Desktop computer in your pocket, this is the phone you need
 Windows 10 make it great
 Is fast and multitasking
 If you are more into Media the Lumia 950 can help better
 Otherwise its excellent and a great price
Battery 🔋 last longer on the Lumia 640
 But it last me the day for me

Absolutely great phone for the very attractive price
 Two SIM cards and expandable memory is all I needed
 Battery is not big but provides whole day of operation, screen is nice, vivid and bright
 Phone is very light, back cover opens nicely and easy
 Using office 365 subscription on PC and phone provides additional terabyte of storage, so all you pictures, contacts, etc instantly synchronizes on new device seamlessly
 Amount of available apps is perfectly sufficient for me
 Image quality from camera falls a bit behind Lumia 950, but the price is unbeatable
 Phone delivers value for your money if you are using Windows 10 platform
 Love it

The manuals are in Chinese making it very difficult
As someone before me said, working with this phone is a charm
 This is a very good business oriented phone
 Double SIM support, fast and responsive, very nice looking and unbelivable light

Very nice phone
 Wonderful screen and light

Excellent product and seller
This is a great phone
 You will not be disappointed
 And for sure it is GSM unlocked
 Shipping is also quick

I have always had a love for Windows Phones, my daily device is a Lumia 920, which I still really love
 As head of an I
T department, i have been under pressure from the "app crazy" crazy crowd, let's be honest, I challenge any other phone is to beat Windows Phone for business
 If business is what you are about, these phone will win hands down
 This Lumia 650 is almost perfect
 Right balance of weight, good screen size, very good battery life


and the most needed apps for business productivity
 Don't mind those who keep whining about the app gap, I have bought 4 recently, with no issues
 Users are happy
 I also bought 2 950XL's
 This is a very solid line of phones

Had to upgrade from my previous Windows 10 non lumia phone
 Pretty happy with that model
 Great design, really good lcd with Lumia glance screen option which I used to enjoy on my Nokia 925

I bought this for my wife and she loves it
 We both have the ATT SIM cards for Straight Talk BYOP, and this phone took the card no problem
 It's a dual SIM so the "no SIM" had to be worked around(made everything go to the second SIM card slot)

Great phone
 I have almost no issue with this phone
 I know everyone says that it doesn't have enough apps but I have all the ones I want other then an app for my bank but I just pull it up on the browser
 Has very good battery life and the os works extremely smooth after a week of playing with it
 My guess is the phone is trying to figure out my habits
 I wish more people and companies would support the windows phone to get more stuff for it, but its their loss on a great phone
 The only thing that could make this phone better is if was the 950
 I have an iPhone 6 from work and I had the google phone and I prefer this hands down to the others

Comparing the Nokia Lumia 1520 and the Microsoft Lumia 650 I felt a huge downgrade
 The cell phone is ok but the screen resolution isn't high and brilliant as expected
 The processor isn't very response

windowsphone are #1
The cellphone is very nice and with good characteristics so far, such as Display, the camera resolution, the Apps, the design


But one of what I don't appreciate on this Phone is the rapid discharging of the battery
 The Battery is really discharging so easily even when put the battery on save battery mode

It's an OK phone but still having some glitzes with it

I've been using Lumia handsets for a while, and always the only complain about it was the finishes of the plastic, well, problem solved
 I'm really surprised with this phone, it feels nice with the back cover in mate and the metal brushed frame it has nothing to envy to many flagships on the market
 The screen is awesome and the 5" are enough to satisfied my demands
 But not everything is perfect, there's two points that Microsoft failed, the chipset it is not enough to handle Windows Phone 10 ( with the 640XL I have no issues at all), and the battery life is good but it's necessary to charge it day by day
 Finally I value the service received by the vendor who sent it fast and everything was fine

RM-1154 On T-mobile shows LTE and 4G in Connecticut

A really nice phone, battery life is good for a smart phone, the screen resolution is very good the its light weight, the memory is also expandable with an sd micro card 4g network makes browsing excellent
 However a down side is the app store from microsoft is a little behind the rivals (step up microsoft) overall its a great tool and for the price thumbs up

This is the best possible windows business phone
 It even looks better than 950
 Two sims is a dream
 Finally, I don't have to run with two phones
 It is fast enough, but not as smooth as 950
 nothing freezes though
 However, the battery sucks


 It is brand new, I have to charge it during the day
 Not a problem for me, but I would love to have it heavier/bigger, but with a decent battery

Love it
 The battery was draining at the beginning, but I followed these instructions and problem solved: [


]
Working with this phone is a charm
 No continuum but there is mirror casting with very good latency
However the phone runs very fluent with W10 and screen is buttery
 The battery life downside i haven't noticed that yet

The white Lumia 650 is very beautiful
 It worked on my Ting mobile in Minnesota
 The phone's processor is powerful, and it's a light phone
 I'm very happy with Windows 10

The best good locking windows phone
 Un big problemi : the battery
 Very bad
 You Luke if you male to 1 oe 2 oclock in the afternoon

Excellent Phone fulfilling every minimum requirement as a low cost smart phone
The person whom I bought it for is very pleased

Absolutely great phone for the very attractive price
 Two SIM cards and expandable memory is all I needed
 Battery is not big but provides whole day of operation, screen is nice, vivid and bright
 Phone is very light, back cover opens nicely and easy
 Using office 365 subscription on PC and phone provides additional terabyte of storage, so all you pictures, contacts, etc instantly synchronizes on new device seamlessly
 Amount of available apps is perfectly sufficient for me
 Image quality from camera falls a bit behind Lumia 950, but the price is unbeatable
 Phone delivers value for your money if you are using Windows 10 platform
 Love it

AL RIGHT
Item isn't as described and seller is not an easy person to negotiate
It was exactly as advertised, and it got here earlier than expected
The manuals are in Chinese making it very difficult
As a previous owner of a Microsoft Lumia 640 this phone is a leap in quality and design
 Excelent value for money
 The touch screen is incredible
Highly recommended if you don't need all the apps offered for Android or IOS cell phones
Great looks too

As someone before me said, working with this phone is a charm
 This is a very good business oriented phone
 Double SIM support, fast and responsive, very nice looking and unbelivable light

Very nice phone
 Wonderful screen and light

I used to love windows phones to death, had one for at least three years, but last year I decided to switch to an iphone 6
 I didn't love the iphone os and it made me miss my windows os, yet I did adore the phone itself
 However when it broke and had no warranty I decided to change it and buy again a windows phone
 However, my return has not been great
 Obviously this is a budget phone, but it does feel like a downgrade
 I find that in the year I've been gone from the operating system there haven't been any improvement
 There is still no Snapchat, google maps, and the app store feels worse than before
 I also feel like the phone itself is slow some times and unresponsive
 What I do love is the OS, despite the lack of apps I still adore the tile based UI that made me fall in love with it
 Also, the xbox live integration actually makes me want to play games
 It also feels and despite the price looks nifty
 I am waiting for the surface phone to upgrade, but I do admit that if it doesn't have something mindblowing might have to return to iOS or Android 

Works great, was exactly like I expected

Works great I love the phone the only thing I didn't like about it was it came with an Australian charge cord they put an adaptor in with it but it should have been listed it was this way
OS is solid
 Build quality isn't
 Front facing camera isn't that good
 Battery consumption is ridiculous - hogs a lot
 App support is awful
 Probably won't be using this for long

Great phone
 Nothing I don't like about it
Screen: Excellent response and looks great
Battery: I go a full day on a charge
 You may not if you're using it for a wifi connection or voice all day
 The fact that the battery is so easily replaceable is HUGE for me
 I just carry an extra battery in my backpack
 When the battery is low I can simply swap it
 Best possible option for me
 I've never that guy at the airport running around looking for power like iPhone owners
Cover: This is different from any other phone: the case IS the cover
 So when you buy a new case you're replacing the entire cover of the phone
 So your case doesn't need to fit over the factory case - it replaces it
 Very nice design
 So many nice cases available for this phone
 I have a leather case that gets compliments all the time
OS: I think you either like Windows Phone OS or you don't
 Very intuitive to me
 Does what I expect it to when I expect it to
 I like the tiled navigation page
 So easy to rearrange and resize tiles
The only issues I can see with this and other Windows phones is the lack of software support
 Waze, for example is fairly crippled on Windows vs
 Android
 All the other apps I need are there
 But clearly far fewer apps than Android and iPhones have
 Not an issue for me

good camera, phone is good; wi fi not as good as the model 640
 Personally the 640 is a better phone for less than a third the price

got this to replace my htc one m8 which I had dropped in 5 feet of water while at lake
 Always wanted a 950 but was initially too expensive I purchased a dual sim 950 for 309
00 setup was eay and the phone works great could not be more pleased
Really made a mistake here
 The phone and OS are really glitch, constantly freezes
 Sometimes miss amazing moments of photos of my kids because the phone freezes after taking a single picture
 I purchase phones once every couple of years and i'm stuck with this thing now because no one wants to buy a phone like this
 Should have thought it through
 Really upset that I purchased this

Very good phone, and perfect price

It works properly

Wonderful high resolution touch screen
 Fast hexcore processor
 3gig memory, 32 meg internal storage
 Can use huge microSD card
 I put 64gig in mine When used continuosly as a laptop replacement for a few hours phone gets warm but functions perfectly
 Continuous intense use runs battery down in 8 to12 hours
 Looks and works as good as any smartphone on the market with Windows 10 near seamless integration across all Windows 10 OS devices and Microsoft cloud
 I use Office 365 on my 4 computers and 3 smartphones
 Works really well fo me and my clients

I actually purchased this for my son
 He loves it as a phone but now that Pokemon GO came out I've heard him grumble over and over that he wishes people would write good games for the windows platform

I was skeptically excited for this new phone featuring windows 10
 I'm a long time android and apple user who was not at all disappointed
 But of course no OS is perfect
 It doesn't crash as much as android and yet allows for more customization and freedom to do with your device what you want
 I got nervous about not being able to find my way around but it's surprisingly logical the way it's all set up
 The screen is beautiful and the features are out of this world
 It competes with iPhone 7 and galaxy S7 based on their hype
 Was also nervous about buying an unlocked phone but these people did it right
 I would buy from them again

Solid phone, a mature Windows phone with an amazing camera, top battery life

Its excellent what I expected
Did not specify it was a dual sim phone
 Everything else is okay

tl;dr: this is a good phone for people that like the Windows os, especially at the current price
I got into Windows phones about 2 years ago after having the Nexus 3 and Nexus 5 android phones
 I've used some "budget" Windows phones from Nokia and decided to give the 950 a try a few months ago since it was being offered at a big discount to retail on Amazon
 I liked Windows because I don't use a lot of apps (10-15 usually will do it) and all the ones I do use are on the platform -- if you are an "app for everything person" then Windows phones are likely not for you
 The Windows 10 os makes *significant* improvements over the previous os and it feels like a well integrated, intelligent system to use
 The build quality is at least equal to the Nexus phones and a step up from other Lumias I've used
 Overall if you like Windows this is a terrific phone

Great Phone
 My second Windows phone replacing my Lumia 928, and it does not disappoint
 Windows 10 Mobile is a very capable operating system and provides a rather snappy tool at my fingertips

My biggest Amazon regret
The phone is okay when I bought it, as what we know for a windows phone
 Some interesting stuff, lack or apps


 But that's fine for me
Then came an update lately
 The usb port doesn't work anymore, I can't neither charge or connect it to my pc, I tried to search for solution online, none of them work
 My last move is to restore factory setting, then battery ran out and I have one more brick in my home
Well play, Microsoft
This is the last time I pay money for a MS product

In some respects this is a great upgrade from my Nokia 1520
 It has Continuum, which I was able to try out in a Microsoft store
 It was great, pretty much a full PC experience with Excel, PowerPoint and the Edge browser open at the same time
 If I had a use for it I'd get the dock, but at $90 it's a bit much for an impulse buy
 It's pretty fast and fluid as well, and despite all you hear about the app gap I have pretty much everything I need on the phone
When I got it, though, it would kill the battery in half a day and get really hot
 It turned out that the SD card that was working fine in my 1520 wasn't good enough for the 950
 You need a really fast card
 That fixed the heat and battery drain, though it definitely isn't as good on battery as the 1520 was
 I also have issues logging into wifi hotspots, where a login page is needed
 Sometimes it doesn't come up and I have to reboot the phone
 Still working through that
So, while the 1520 was definitely a 5 star device, the 950 is only a 4 star, until those issues get sorted

This is one of the zippiest and smoothest working Windows phones
 It is obviously not the best phone out there, but it is great nonetheless
 The major issues, as many will attest, are with the recent bout of Windows updates that vary in effectiveness
 However, after testing Windows 10 on a few low-end devices, the 950 is leaps and bounds better

Purchased for my teenage son that is somewhat of a techno guy


he absolutely loves this phone
 The only phone he has yet to destroy after one week
 He only wish is that it came with more apps

Exelent

Great phone, at this price point the look an feel should be more premium, specially in the case
 Besides that I like it a lot
 Windows 10 is fast, friendly and intuitive
 Loved the face recognition feature

excellent
Excelent

Nice device and it was delivered really fast and without a scratch
I love this phone
 For the price I got it for (around $320) the competition would have less features
 This phone has the best camera I've used
 It also never lags and has great battery life
 The integration with regular Windows is compelling
 I am using it with a 128gb SD card so it has 160GB total
 Offline maps take about 4GB for states I frequently visit
 Its very light and thin
 Would recommend to a friend who isn't obsessed with Snapchat (bleh) :-)
While the 950XL is more powerful, the price increase is not justifiable at this time
 This phone will do everything you need it to do and then some while providing you with the best call quality aroundIf you already have a Windows Phone 10 device, the upgrade process is pretty painless as you turn on the phone
 make some basic choices and then it asks you to sign in
 Once you do that, the phone will restore your settings and download all of the applications you had installed before you swapped your phone
Pros:AMOLED ScreenBattery lifeIris scannerIntegration with Windows 10 desktopLight weight for it's sizeReplaceable battery (if you can find one)USB-C charge/data port where it does not matter how you plug it in since it is reversibleCons:feels kind of cheap in the hand


Microsoft has taken Windows Phone 8 and made it even better in WP 10
 and this device shows off those results really well
 The hardware makes the OS experience butter smooth and there is absolutely NO lag
The screen is absolutely CLEAR and there is nary a pixel to be seen
 text is crisp and easy to read
 Color reproduction is very accurate and movies and other well encoded media looks absolutely amazingInternal Storage is 32GB which should be enough room for apps that will not install to the SD card and you get 26 of that for your useExpandable storage is (currently) limited to the largest micro SD card available 200GBBrowsing: It seems to be pretty good


 but due to small screen size, not much is gained by the higher resolutionCall quality is excellentBattery life: it will make it through the day on a single charge
The most important for me is that it let me work smoothly in my Windows ecosystem: laptop, tablet phone, xbox

Great cellphone, great size, great software and better apps

The unit arrived in good condition the box did not have the original seals on it which was troubling but I went for it anyway

Not too bad

Great phone but Microsoft OS update was PAINFUL

Good hardware, not so flashy but a decent case fixes that anyway

Works great I love the phone the only thing I didn't like about it was it came with an Australian charge cord they put an adaptor in with it but it should have been listed it was this way

I will not be returning this item as I previously mentioned
 Changed my mind

Nice
Nice for the price but slow and small

Got two for one reason 

 It's unlock and my dad and uncle use it 



 Lol
It's nice and I love it for z price but I brought it for Africa so I will c how it work over there ;)
Poor quality and therefore does not my desire
No like is plastic
FAst shipment and phone was even better than described
 Very very happy ty




Not bad
Good Phone but a few things to note for American purchasers1)
 The charger that comes with it won't work in US outlets
 Fortunately, I have a spare Lumia 635 charger that works
 However, I did decide to buy a charger designed for the 640 so it can charge properly2)
 I might be missing something but it appears that this phone doesn't support LTE speeds
 I won't go into a technical discussion
 What I can say definitively is that when you get to the data speed connection settings that highest it goes to is 4G
 Looking at another site I did notice that the a 640 LTE unlocked version If data speed is vital investigate with your carrier
 I use ATT 
 Cavet emptor on my part
 I was a little too excited to get this and didn't fully research it
 It's a good phone and well worth looking into

Be aware this is NOT a dual sim phone as stated in the questions and answers
 It is an RM-1072 Lumia 640 LTE with a single sim
 I'm not happy about this, but have decided to keep it
 I don't believe this is the seller's fault, but is the either the result of incorrect answers, wrong questions linked to the wrong product, or a change in what the seller used to ship
 I like the phone, but would have preferred a dual sim

very good
Great phone like it
A good product and a good seller, recomended
Awesome phone
 Here is my situation
 I used to carry 2 phones at work, one for work, one personal
 It got to be a pain, but due to the type of work I do, I don't really want to be giving out my personal cell number
 With this phone, I put both SIM cards in and away I went
 Syncs with Microsoft account and Exchange server at work
Pros: Text and phone messages can be sent on designated lines
 Phone is fast and responsive
 EXCELLENT camera
 Syncs with Microsoft account
 Huge 5 inch screen
Cons: Only one ring tone
 Cant customize SIM ring tones
 Edit: To clarify, the phone allows you to use as many ring tones as you would like
 You can assign different ring tones to each contact
 What I originally meant was, There is currently no way to give each SIM its own ring tone
 Specifically to have SIM1 sound different from SIM2
 I would like to be able to tell by the tone if the incoming call is from my personal or work line

Worked perfectly in Asia
 Just add a local SIM card
Works great, Price is great
If If you are not at&t costumer and want to use another sim card(international), you just need to remove at&t sim put in yours and enter unlock code, which is written on package of the phone

Bought it for my wife and she's loving it, an excellent upgrade to her 620
Good phone
A wonderful phone, easy to use with Windows and all the programs I need from Windows office


great phone

I did not use the phone , I returned it

Excellent phone
 Works like charm, I have used like 10 android phones, but love the quality
 Got one for my wife but would have kept iff only microsoft has all the google apps :(
good phone, especially for the price

I bought this telephone as unlocked and it's locked by AT&T, I wan't my money back
Excelent
It's a good phone and well worth the price
 It just has some minor problems
There are some really bad pre-installed apps that you can't delete (FM Radio, Internet Explorer, etc
)
 You can counter this by choosing custom apps in the store, however Windows doesn't have nearly the same selection/variety that Android Smartphones have
Microsoft Office is really good on the go for those moments a burst of inspiration one might get without having a pen and paper available to jot down ideas
 There is also OneDrive storage available for any of your file needs--Or you can insert a Micro SD of your choosing
 Nearly half of the phone's 8GB storage is used on system files
Had no problems using the phone/messaging programs
 Make sure you read the details about which companies are suitable for it
 CDMA networks don't work with this phone (Verizon, T-Mobile)

This product is being sold through misleading information
 The description of the product states that it is "unlocked" and is an "international version"
 However upon receiving the product I found that the phone has been locked by AT&T 

Great
Excelent seller and item, thank's very much

i gave it as a gift and the receiver is very happy with the phone and thanked me for such a lovely gift
The phones aren't unlocked please send me the activation code
 Please thanks
It's pretty good phone for low this price
 The only issue is that the network keeps on fluctuating and it goes on offline when its on stand by for a while (using it on T-mobile)
 Everything else is just flawless

My Microsoft Nokia Lumia 640 LTE was received as advertised with instructions to unlock the phone
 I purchased this phone for traveling to Hungary & Serbia this summer
 I purchased a Telestial International SIM Card, installed the sim followed the unlocking directions provided with the phone and it went perfectly
 I prefer the windows phone over Android and am very pleased with how the phone and camera performs

Correct

Love it
No
A good product value for money and with latest technology 4G Which is just launched in india
Can not beat the price it's worth it
Its good
Amazing phone

 Switched my SIM card and it fired right up

 Love this phone

Nice

excellent little phone
arrives late, NO usb cord going from phone to pc
 NO guide book let for phone
 The box said everything inside and most important stuffs are missing/
Love this phone
 No sticking, moves quickly enough, slim and pretty
 Bought this phone month ago and have no regrets

The price is very good, but if you've ever used an iPhone you won't be satisfied with Windows OS
If you want to use it as a second phone or hotspot you're good to go
 Wouldn't recommend it as your primary though
Very good phone, I bought about 4 to different family, all very happy
 Good product for the price

My review is based on how it came
 The phone came appearing new, had everything it was supposed to start service, except a SIM card, not in or out of the phone
 It said in the booklet that it was pre-installed, however, no SIM card was pre - anything
 Non-existent
 Would return this for the SIM card missing and for the hassle in getting service for the phone, but that's another hassle, and loss
 The phone seems nice quality, just disappointed in the fact that all the pieces to begin service are missing, and now have to wait, when we needed a working phone now

This is a badass phone
 equivalent to or better than other more expensive phones


 one aspect i really like is how it easily brings together all my microsoft devices

Probably is a really nice phone but despite watching 2 U Tube videos on how to remove the back of the phone so the battery and SIM card can be inserted, I could not get the back off
 Broken thumb nails down to the quick of the nails on both hands to show for my efforts
 Followed all directions to the letter and the back just will not release so I have requested a return from the seller and am waiting for an RMA

Excellent
(Disclaimer: I'm not very demanding when it comes to phones, so take this review with a grain of salt
)I am honestly amazed at the fact that it is possible to buy (100% outright, no contract, any carrier) for less than a C-bill
 This thing exceeds my expectations in every department
 Well, except app availability but I knew that going in
 I am particularly impressed with the battery life
The only con I can think of is that mine didn't actually ship with the unlock code like the description says; I had to go to ATT's website and request an unlock code from them
 Which went fine, but took a couple days and had me a little worried since I'm not an ATT customer and I don't really understand why they would have to unlock my phone for me

Just as described, works well
Windows phone Lumia is one of the best cellphones that I have had
 Easy to use, practical and so fast


and the best part, it's price



Best Budget Windows Phone
Good item, good price



I chose this phone over the old Lumia 920 my wife didn't like it at first, now she absolutely love it just for the size of the screen, it is mush easier to read from and lighter so it's better to use for a long conversation

A really great phone for a small price
 only complaint some apps not available on the phone
Love this phone



works
Half price in Target
 Missed out a bargain
Excellent device, I love Windows phone
 It's so solid and excellent camera


 the phone has the big battery
The phone was brand new, and the shipping was on time
 The reason why I am giving this product two stars is due to it not being unlocked, along with nothing in the package to unlock the phone
 I had to get it unlock by another site
 The description of this is false
 But once it is unlocked it worked great

Good and seller was very helpful when I needed it
Phone not comes with unlock code and process to unlock

Love ❤ it
 Easy to use

It works really good
 I am using it in Costa Rica on the Movistar's network and it works fine for both phone calls and internet access (3G-4G)
 I have been using Lumia devices since 2012 so I already know how to use it
 I always prefer a Lumia over an Android based device
 Lumia devices with Windows Phone are a lot more stable and the calendar, contacts and mail applications which are native are great, everything is always synchronized

I like this windows phone, there is not a lot of junk apps
 It is a little lacking in apps, compared to android

works great
I bought it for an expensive price on Amazon
 The phone is OK although the resolution is low
 It is usable, but you should not expect too much from this affordable phone
Hope my comment help

great item
Excellent phone, well worth the purchase
 It is of very good quality and arrived in perfect condition
 Thank you

Though it was unlocked internationally
Excellent Phone
ok
Did not come unlocked
 As soon it was turned on it was locked to ATT as it had an ATT simcard inside
 No instructions on how to avoid this

Great starter phone for those that want to transition into windows
 With a Cricket sim card I didn't have to do the unlocking procedure

This phone is awesome to have it is to love it
 I bought mine and totally i am in love with this phone
I do encourage anyone to buy it
 Features are great and it comes with a personal assistant called Cortana

I already had a windows phone in the past but his time they manage to suprass all my expectations
 All the hardware shown in the description make the phone run smoothly in every action you make with it, the camera is fantastic and since the store doesn't have some of the official apps the community adds there own and work just fine
Now about the customer support
 CrazyLowPrices are what most sellers should be, to let myself clear, this cellphone came with no activation code, this doesn't happends often this time was just unfortunate but as soon as i report it to them and within a few days they send me the code and got the phone load and ready to use
 I would recomend this anytime

I love the Windows phone personally, I have heard some people don't like it because they can't figure it out, but thats why I like it
 It has so many options


This is a great phone at a great price
 Forget I Phones and S6, I could buy 10 of these phones and still have money left over
 The other thing about this phone that is better than the other phones - it's a windows phone,,a much better operating system
 If you want a great phone and don't want to break the bank buy this

if you buy this phone the description of it is a joke , he says that this release for the band 3 to 4g and a lie does not work
Simply an amazing phone
Great product

The best cell phone I 've ever had
 Easy , dynamic and quite complete 
 Worthwhile for all who seek change Android and Iphone
 It's very cheap , fast shipping and a fair size 

Great phone great price unlock
The delivery was fast
 And I like the phone
very happy excellent

Excellent
Awesome phone
Value for money
Excelente producto

EQUIPMENT NOT WORKING ON WITH BAND 1800 MHZ 4G 

Great
 Totally satisfied
90% of the time I don't have signal, I don't receive messages or calls
 Good electronic, but bad phone

what a deal
This phone was said to be an unlocked one, but it turned out to be an AT&T go-phone that was still locked to the carrier

I can't activate the phone
where can I get activation code

Phone worked very good in US
 But when i came to India phone did not worked
 It's asking unlock code

Excellent, five star

My husband and kids gave the phone for mothers day as a gift I love the camera and how fast it is

The phone seems to be as advertised and to work as designed
 But, after being used to Win 7 and to an iPhone 4s, I was not able to understand how it worked after a little bit of trying, it seemed to be focused on internet fun and not on the simpler functions of phone and text messaging, and I decided that I really don't want to learn yet another quirky operating system, namely with the "tiles
" So, I have abandoned it and replaced it with a different type of phone
 Perhaps I can sell it on eBay
 I gave up on my Apple iPhone because there was so little control of how it worked, or at least that is how it seems
 At first, with the 4S, I could access my photos from my windows computer, but then that feature went away during some "update
" Sure, I could use The Cloud, but I don't want to

For this price this is an excellent phone
 Phone display is impressive, camera is good, battery life good, speaker also okay
 No so much a fan of Windows OS
 The phone is also unlocked by seller
Purchased from seller Aimportar and delivery was super fast

Good phone, especially for the money
 Works with MetroPCS service
 Does everything I need a cellphone to do

Really really dislike this product
 Signal sucks
 Slow phone

I like speaker sound
Hi
 I bought this cell on March 4, but now try to use it but ask me a code
 I want to use outside the United States
 Please help with the respective code
Sincerely,Diana Chevez
it works very well
very very nice and good
Very good phone for the price, look and feels well built
Absolutely worthless


even simple phone call is not supported at all
Great phone
 I love it

I received my windows phone , I love it 
 Trusted seller brand new out the box , unlocked, I am on a metro pcs plan
 I was able to switch over my service quickly, everything worked out well
 Great phone Thank you
Great phone for the price
 Not to small not to big, love cortana, the camera, the phone overal
 Also shipped fast
Good choice
Excellent phone for its money
Worked without issues
As a first time smart phone user, this phone is perfect for me
 Similar to my computer, easy to figure out, not expensive
 It doesn't have access to as many apps as an Apple or Android device, if that is important to you
 For me, it's a great fit

I bought this product to sent to a family member in Brazil
 My nephew was very disappointed when he opened and tried to install a Brazilian SIM card to find out it doesn't work there
 Also: the cell phone itself was locked (it was sold as unlocked) , and both, box and cell were from the brand ZTE and not what I originally ordered: MICROSOFT NOKIA LUMIA 640 LTE RM-10728GB
 The only one original Microsoft Nokia Lumia 640 item in the package was the label on top of the ZTE-label
 To my fully disappointment, I also found the exact ZTE- cell phone for 59US$ at Amazon
com
 Now, the cell phone is in Brazil and not working
 I am very disappointed

i like it

Good product
Very good
Excellent phone
It is a phone very fast, it's OS is easy to use single for every one
 It would better if more app are developed
I just received my phone and I ordered an UNLOCK PHONE as it stated but received "locked Phone , I believe if u specifically stated that the phone "UNLOCK" it should be 

 now I have to pay extra money to unlock it



my Sister like it :)
Works great
No complains so far from the person I bought it for
It's a beautifulIt's work well
Excellent
Low cost phone
 A good design, fine stats for what I do which doesn't include gaming on my phone any more
 I have a PC and my roommate has an xbox one
 Don't need games on my phone


Point is I don't know how they run
 Battery life seems fine
 I am running Ting which makes this phone even better for me
 I would have been sad to have to get another phone to switch over services to Ting

The win phone work from Jun 9, 2016 to September 15, 2016
 Terrible experience after 9/15/2016 when everything stop working
 It start with photo gallery not responding and then follow by everything disappear from the screen
 Soft reset hard reset did not fix anything
 I cannot believe Microsoft is unable fix all the problems and cannot deliver reliable and functional product
 Don't update the phone as everything started after the update

Phone was purchased to replace a failed 640
 Packing was good and everything working as advertised
 Was able to get onto the T-Mobile network without problem
 Some have complained about the lack of LTE, but for my 72-year old mother-in-law, it is perfect for her needs
 In fact, she is loving Cortana, hands free, and the maps app on Windows 10 Mobile
 A+
I had a flip phone, this makes texting easy , good price , too bad Windows Phones are not popular

I have had several phones of this model
 Last one I bought is the worst, it restarts several times during the day
 I do not recommend it, quality is poor, unreliable

Good cellphone for the price it's like iPhone 5 performance but better

I brought as international version
 But I received RM-1073 model and doesn't work at 800 hz



Great phone for the Price
 Bought it , unlocked it and used it with my operator (from Argentina) in USA and back in my country with no problems
 One sugestion though, is that amazon should not advertize it as unlocked, it is an ATT with unlock code
 Not a big deal anyway
I purchased this lumia640 for a gift to my sister who lives in other country , but she can't start the phone it's asking for a pin code don't know why new phone is asking for password to start
 No idea what number to enter😁
does anybody has an idea



Bla




If you have one you already know I'm great phone fantastic pictures
 Cortana vasilli little bit of work
 But still I love my phone

It works perfect
 Thanks

Excelent
excellent device , functional and unlocked
 grateful
This is my first smartphone and i'm very happy with it

A good phone
 A big improvement on my previous Nokia phone

Very affordable, almost complete phone
 Only issue is camera is not better than Galaxy S5 during low light
 Battery, build quality, display, color accuracies are great
 Windows 10 works flawless on it
 Highly recommend it

I'm so happy with this phone, I love windows phone, and this phone comes with the unlock code, (I bought two and the two comes with the code) I'm from costa Rica
 Thanks for the phone

❤
This is a good bang-for-the-buck phone
 It has front camera, flash, 4G LTE etc
 It is fairly water tolerant (used it while it was raining)
 It is light too
 The battery lasts for a day easily with just phone calls and browsing
 I only charge once in 2 days
One thing that I loved in it compared to Android phones is - it has terrific ringtones for alarms, phone calls and messages (that's more a comment on Windows 8 rather than the phone itself)
 The tile UI for organizing apps is also very nice
Windows does not have the same level of App coverage as iOS or Android
 So, that is a pain
 For example, Uber App on the phone barely works
 Lyft does not even start
 There is no support for GMail, voice navigation for maps, Google Voice

Good, Exelent

I got this phone to use with straight talk at&t
 My previous phone was a galaxy s3 that was originally through Verizon but it was "unlocked"

 Then switched to straight talk ATT but would never get anything but edge network
 I had it 3 1\2 yrs and loved it


 Now I have had this Lumia 640 for 2 days and love it
 Works smooth no lagging so far
 The sound is great
 The screen is crisp and clear
 For $100 or so this is by far the best phone out


 I was going to pay $150 for another galaxy s3 through straight talk and I'm so glad I didn't


if you want a nice phone like galaxy or LG look here first
The battery is horrible but otherwise its a good phone

Good price, good product,good quality
Good seller, good phone
 No problems, phone shipped quickly, policy question answered promptly before purchase by seller
 Phone is a little slower than expected and has locked up couple of times, but still a crazy good value
 My iPhone gets weird sometimes too and was 10x the price
 Lumia's a four star
 Five stars is for the seller

Long battery usage, less expensive but very useful
very good product, I recommend
Pay for RM-1072 and recieve an RM-1073

very disappointed i feel stolen i paid for an unlocked internacional phone and recived one locked requesting unlocked code

Great phone, came as promised, on time, unlocked, and with Windows 10 installed
 Highly recommend, especially at the low price
 For me it's an opportunity to try out Windows 10 without having to install it on my computer
 So far, I like the phone and the operating system better than my iPhone 4
 Only drawback is the lack of apps available for Windows 10: e
g
, no PaybyPhone or mobile banking available, Overdrive won't work on the Microsoft Edge browser and Evernote is unusable
 Even so it's a great format, super fast and super easy to learn and use

I love my new phone I'm using it right now
 Is exactly as seller described fast shipping had no problems with it did not need to contact seller
Excellent phone for the price, I recommend
My son said its perfect and he love it
Its a great phone have not had any issues




I needed an unlocked phone for my Digicel SIM card - will use this phone in Belize - and this phone is going to be perfect - works with WiFi with all the bells and whistles when WiFi is available
 It was nerve-wracking to cut the old SIM card (standard size) to the micro SIM size required for this phone, but I watched a couple of videos and took the plunge
 I was doing the happy dance when I got my first text from Digicel, welcoming me to the United States
 Can't wait to take it to Belize and use it

It's a awesome phone with low price and a great performance
 The only thing is that some apps are not as develop as the android ones
 But is worth it cuz this phone is really fast and the apps from Microsoft and Lumia are wonderful
 I'm really glad I change my galaxy S3 for this Lumia
I thing is a very good phone but the phone need development 

Nice phone 📱 but think now will get xl model so I can have both😀
Good phone
Excelente
Very good telephone
 Convenient price
 I used as my 2nd telephoneSummary:Pros:+ nice 4" screen same iphone 6+ good response speed in functions+ Most of the needed apps available (watsap, skype, tunein, twitter, etc, )+ with w8
1 sync with icloud is transparent creating just the icloud email accout+ Price
 high hardware at low cost+ same configuration screens as our Windows pc's (for a telephone)+ Accept W10 Mobile+ Good recepetion, speed, functionsCons:- With W10 not working sync with icloud anymore- some not common apps no available (i
e
 Nut , cozmo)- vpn configuration block the telephone functions and not working (ppt, l2tp)-
The phone is unlocked but it asking me the protective recovery code i don't know where i can get the recovery code for this phone
Supposed to
 Be an unlocked phone it was a at&t phone but nice phone
So far very impressed
 The phone was unlocked
Overall it works great


The battery life is pretty decent
This cellphone is perfect for me
Great and efficient service from seller
 Totally recomended

good
Works great, good value if you aint tryna drop tons of money to get a smartphone

A very good phone that is even easy to use

Excelentes
I love it

Perfect for what I want it for the basics yet still it looks and works like one of the more expensive smartphones
Regards
have problems with your computer did not come unlocked and as I have understood buy with unlocking included I wonder if they produced an unlock code
Microsoft continuing to deliver excellent value for money with their Lumia range
 I had a 540 earlier, and moved to the 640 for a larger screen
 I am very satisfied with this handset
 Some specifics
 Sound quality is very good, the navigator is very accurate and helpful
 The quality of the pictures is great
 I would recommend it to anyone looking for a value-for-money smartphone

Fast delivery, received a decent phone, large responsive screen, the battery life is just about right although it takes longer to charge
 When you need a decent phone with good interface and functionality, you can't go wrong with a Lumia 640 LTE
wow
 just wow


 I cant believe this phone is only $100
 how is it possible
 I bought one for my mom thinking that she does not need a fancy phone, but I liked it so much I bought one for my dad too :) when my android phone dies, I will switch to windows and probably get one of these phones :) It is a pretty good phone
 The screen resolution is not as high as iphone or samsung, BUT 1- it is not bad at all and 2- due to lower screen resolution, the battery lasts 2-3 days instead of 1 day

 I have to charge my nexus 5 at least twice a day


 It has a decent processor
 It has a memory expansion slot
 It has basic apps you would need from a smart phone (No you cant play clash of clans, No it does not have 1 kazillion apps like android does), but I dont use a lot of apps either
 It is a great deal for someone who wants to have a decent smartphone
 I still cant believe it is only $100

This is an excellent phone

Nice
This review is for the Lumia RM-1073 (AT&T version) sold by CrazyLowPricesForYou
I live in Costa Rica, I use Movistar as a Carrier with 4G LTE
 So the phone comes like is should, with the charger, USB cable, 2500 removable battery and the phone itself, a AT&T sim and a printed paper with the instructions for make the phone fully unlocked as well
Which totally worked for me on the first try (remember that after 10 failed attempts the phone is no longer able to be unlocked, so do it carefully)
 I am not going to make a review about the software, because I am part of the Windows 10 Insider program and already upgraded this phone to W10 Mobile
 So I am not going to make software reviews on a beta OS just yet but for me battery life is good so far
The phone fells good in the hand, the screen is really good for the density of pixels it has and the performance so far with games is decent
 The main camera is average but still better than older Lumias like 820 and 535
 The front facing camera is ok but if you want to upload selfies to Instagram will look washed out until you get a really good light to compensate the noise and lack of resolution
What I really love is that, with this same hardware, an Android phone is lagging so bad and Windows Mobile (beta) and Windows Phone 8
1 are rocking better
For the rest as a power user you can't beat this price
 For the people asking in Latin American countries for this phone, I repeat, the Lumia 640 RM-1073 that sells CrazyLowPricesForYou you can use this phone with your local carrier (just check the frecuency bands are compatible with your carrier)
 I test it with Movistar and Kolbi in Costa Rica
 This phone cost me 56 mil colones ($120) going through taxes and shipping here
 My parents and some friends want some of this phones so I am going to order more but if you look for a better camera and better battery life look for the Lumia 640 XL
 If a big screen scares you, then this phone is what you are looking for

good cellphone
I found out this phone is a really good phone
Good, no issues with it
 Its very light weight and for now the battery backup is good

worst phone turns off evry second , i have to reboot this 3 times per week,and very littl space wish i could get a refund
I am not an expert smart phone user
 This is my second smart phone ever
 I thought the Microsoft device would be relatively user friendly, and easy to operate
 But, buying this Microsoft cell phone was a big my istake
 Should have bought an Adndoid instead
 It is very difficult to set up Gmail account on this Microsoft phone
 It takes you in circles around and around, and at the end of the circles you find yourself at the first plate
 Consumers take a big hit by Microsoft vs Google rivalry
 Now that Microsoft has decided to shut down the Nokia smart phone division and cut down thousands of employees, the future support looks uncertain
 Now I am thinking of donating this phone to someone who does not use Google account on smart phone

Very good phone my son like it very happy he says it work like a computer

It works really well with a few minor malfunctions here and there
its a nice phone
Product arrived in 1 week
 It is a new phone
 It comes with a letter with the unlock code and instructions
 The product is unopened
 The box and the phone have AT&T brand logo but all is new
 I bouht in the US but now I use it in Mexico
 All works done 4G
 :)
Completely satisfied
 Only doubt is that it was supposed to be unlocked but there is a carrier logo

Working well so far

Excellent price for excellent product

Very sophisticate
I love Windows phones and not spending much money
 This was perfect
 I own this phone now and I have to deal with none of that contract crap
 The only thing I didn't like was that the phone was NOT unlocked
 Rather, they provide an unlock code that requires you to place a non-AT&T SIM card into the device
 Well, my prepay plan with Net10, is using AT&T Cell towers so it recognized my SIM as AT&T, and so I couldn't unlock it until I got my hands on a T-Mobile SIM from an old phone I dreged up from the basement
 You could always borrow a friends' SIM, it really doesn't matter and doesn't hurt their SIM
 Even before that, this phone was great
 I love it and according to Microsoft, it will be compatable with Windows 10
 Looking forward to it

wow 😍 ❤ 😍 it this is a keeper I have 520 1320 and Microsoft 640 its the best this is coming from a guy how technology all Nintendo ds Sony phone and ps1to3 and iPad and mac book air Samsung galaxy devices to Xbox to Xbox 360 Lumia phone good with the Xbox 360
oh almost forget the Kindle
Great phone for the price
 Would I like more apps
 Yes
 But that's not the phone's fault
 Great pics
 Great battery life

The phone is great but unfortunately why I don't have the code to unlock the phone that's I got
Where I can find the code

Best phone I have had
It was a cheap phone, and it does exactly what I would want it to--take pictures, manage my calendar, store my documents, etc
 My favorite attribute is the design
 It's simple, fast, and intuitive
 Android might have the apps, but frankly its interface is clunky
 Windows, in terms of looks, is right up there with iPhone even if it lacks some of the functionality
 I also love its ability to manage my professional life
 I never have to worry about what appointments my work has scheduled me for, because the minute I turn it on, it's all there, even if I haven't accepted the invite yet
 This is actually incredibly useful to me, because I have a poor memory and sometimes forget to accept these invites
 Cortana is super responsive as well

Love it
I purchase this product for a customer and less than 2months it drop calls and issue connecting to internet
I purchase another for another customer before getting a feedback from the first customer, they havent been ale to use it cause the phone freeze all the time

thank you
 my sister loves the phone

This was my first windows phone
 It was not user friendly and I ended up giving it away

works well in other country's
Phone is ok, a little big for my taste, but where it really fails is in the camera, the colors are not so bad, except the oranges
 And if you use the flash, all pictures are horrible

Son loves new phone
 It's u locked so he synced old phone and backup
 Took sim card out of old a d put it in
 For an at&t, so he had to delete all at&t apps a d resynced phone



No problems, GSM neteork

After finally giving up on my Moto G4, I bought this which is a small screen display and less specs
 However, I was pleasantly surprised by how clear the screen is outside in the sunlight and how responsive this little 5" display phone reacted
 No lag
 I am even running the latest windows 10 insider upgrade without any issues on it
Ever since Android came out starting with the Verizon Droid, I have used Android
 I played with the Lumia 1600 but just toooo big for my pockets
 I love the response but went back to Android
 Truth of the matter, yes Windows doesn't have all the apps that Android has but they have what I need
 The most important ones were my banking app and it is available from Windows store so I am able to do what I do which is just email, calendar, text, occasion web, GPS where I need to go, mobile banking, and Facebook and messenger
 I don't watch movies so this little puppy does just what I need and it does it quite well
 For the price, I can't beat it
 The Windows OS gets a lot of heat but compared to Android, it is much more fluid and fast
 Sure there are more expensive Android phones with higher specs but why spend the money when you only do what I do everyday

Excelent
Bought this to be used as a tablet, it us capable of doing the job
 My main issue is that I realized I can live without office suite
 Good phone, just need a larger battery and better apps
I will not convince anyone to buy the Lumia 640, it is a matter of taste, I value the price, the equipment and the basics I need a phone
 Before evaluates the productive performance of each operating system and for my Windows Phone Lumia is the maximum
Reliable Communications seller, I have no complains about the service, TalCual was in the picture and the description so it came to my hands, thank you

A bit pricy, but all in all - happy
😞
Ordered RM-1072, received RM-1073 that doesn't have the advertised LTE bands, so doesn't work internationally
 Returned it
 A friend also bought to a different seller and also got a RM-1073 with a unlock code that btw is provided for free by AT&T

I have had another windows phone and liked it very much
 This one had a problem with the screen or something else
 We have had nothing but trouble with it
 I would not suggest purchasing this one

Excellent

I love this phone

 i just switched from a Samsung and will never go back

excelente
I like my phone but some apps wont work the same like facebook and messenger you cannot watch live im a teenager so that's important but other than some apps camera works fine fast phone nice screen size beautiful hd viewing
Works better than an android phone
 Should have switched when they came out



Did Not receive the correct item 
 I received the AT&T Locked Version in error 
 I decided on a different phone and ordered that instead 
 Did Not actually Use this phone 

Does what it promises
 Cheap and loaded with features
 Go for it
very light phone and apps are just what I was looking for

Great phone
, faster than i think for the price, take a few days learn use Windows phone, but is easy; apps run fast

Nice product, very happy with it

Great phone
 Works well
 Pictures and videos are also fine

very good phone for a budget minded customer
 Now this is meant to be my back up phone but with excellent battery life decent camera and fast performance it has become my main phone atleast until the Lumia 950 is released this is priced below its value you point
just bought thi phone from Martian, LC in NH
 It was advertised as UNLOCKED, it is LOCKED and useless
FALSE ADVERTISING

I have been using this phone for a couple weeks, and it is working flawlessly
 As soon as windows 10 is out, it will be updated as well

I love this phone

very good
Phone isn't unlock
 Even though it was advertise as international unlocked phone

I love this phone
 This phone is my phone now

Love it


 Very happy with Nokia 640 my last phone was a Samsung

So far, this has been a great little phone
 It's very handy

Excellent
 I recommend it to everybody
Good phone
 Easy to use
great phone and great service

I specifically bought the international version, which the phone I received is not
 It's an unlocked AT&T GO Phone for $80
 You can buy the AT&T GO Phone for $55 and get the unlock code from AT&T for free (a simple google search will give you easy to follow instructions)
 So buy this phone knowing it's not dual sim, and it's not the true international version, and you're essentially paying an extra $25 for someone to get the code for you

Works like a charm
 I broke the screen but it took 10+ drops and a massive plummet to even accomplish that
 Truly a God send
 Thank God
an amazing phone for this price
 Gave my iPhone6 to my wife and now use the Lumina640
 It is not as good as the iPhone6
 This is clear
 But The price is 1/8 
 So, no complaints
 I had to upgrade the O/S to Win10
 Win8
1, which was on the phone isnt good enough
 The upgrading was a hassle, since the phone is AT&T branded, the upgrade did not work the normal way
 I had to get the Early user Win10 in the Microsoft APP store for the upgrade
 Found nstructions on Youtube
 That worked well
 I like the phone a lot overall
 What I need to get used to is a) the way to answer calls - often I turn away a call when I want to answer it
 And texting also caused issues at times - text seemed to go to wrong numbers
 Did not find out why
 But for those, who use windows and outlook, this is a great phone

Good
nice phone, I like it
MUY BUEN PRODUCTO
I returned this phone because it wasn't a dual sim model although it was advertised as one
 I wanted a dual sim one for frequent international travel

Unlocked and the Phone is great for its price, the shipping was a little bit slow, but not seller fault

Was not unlocked like advertised

Very good option
It was great
LOVE Windows Phones and the money I saved for a new one through Amazon just makes it that much better

 If your on a GSM network such as ATT T Mobile etc


 give it a try



I need a AT&T code for unlocked


 I live in Panama, I can't use sim card
Sorry for my English, speak only Spanish


 xD
this is good item
 i like service
 it was the fastest
 and this product is great
thanks so muchi like it

Very good phone for the money
 Screen is bright and easy to read, sound quality is good and the performance is fast enough for the apps I use
 I am not a power phone user
 To find a reasonably priced phone that did what I needed and did it well was appreciated
this movil is perfect found correct with win 10 mobile
There is no reason to invest more than 200USD in a cellphone these days
 These new Microsoft phones are well-made, really responsive, high-end feeling for less money than your regular Android or iOS device
Pros:Good Screen (720p, IPS Panel, Gorilla Glass 3)Superb Battery Life (48 hours of use, with YouTube, speakers, and social media)Excelent Touch ScreenLoud SpeakersSolid Build (its plastic, but the good one
 Ruged Finish)Nice Size (Its big, like a Samsung S3, but thicker,)Solid OS Performace
 (Windows Phone is one of the most stable OS for phones
 Far better than Android)Replaceable Battery
Superb Camera App & Camera
 (Full manual control like all the Lumia Devices)Works Internationally and its unlocked
 (Using it on Paraguay right now
)Cons:No Win10 build in
Poor Apps Store and Apps Quality
 (The basics are there, but they are poorly design)No Shutter buttom in the phone (this is a step backwards from other Lumia devices)













 01 June 2016 



















Microsoft literally has abandoned the platform
 There where no updates in the last 4 o 5 months
 Instagram and other apps started to crush
 If the manufacture don't support the OS with software updates, the phone becomes useless
 SOFTWARE sells Hardware, and unfortunately this bargain of hardware its throw to waste
Windows Phone ship now is sinking


 do not buy













 19 June 2016 



















Updating to 5 Stars Again

 the Phone Just recive the Windows 10 Update treatment
 But you have to Download an APP from the store to do it
 When Running WIN10 Mobile, you got a new Facebook & Instagram Apps that works flawlessly with all the features
 Great Job Microsoft

 but this update came to late


 Windows Mobile is diying
Anyway, for the money, this is a great Smartphone


 (If is running win10 mobile)
Excellent phone
 Very good deal

Phone functioned well enough but original language was Italian and was hard to get it changed and it would not mesh well with my local network
It's a good phone when it works
 I don't know if it's the phone or the service , but service drops in and out 
Plus the screen cracked very easy after the phone was dropped from 3 feet

Worked Great 

5 star PHONE for it's price
 4 stars due to the app store
 The front and back camera are good, especially when combined with Lumia Selfie and Lumia Camera, allowing you to control a lot of elements in the photo
 Windows 8 runs perfectly, but the Windows 10 update is still a LITTLE buggy
 Read reviews complaining about how its "not compatible with apps like google play" with a grain of salt because each OS has its own store
 IE you cant get the android store on iOS
Windows lets me seamlessly switch between my CPU, Laptop, Tablet, and Phone easily
 The windows store is not as heavily stocked with apps as Apple or Android
 Apps run by google are also restricted
 For instance things like Youtube don't have an official app, but they are easily replaced with other apps such as Tube Pro
 It has all the popular and essential games and apps but dont expect new apps to instantly develop after they have been released on iOS or Android
This is an amazing phone and I've used Samsung, Apple, LG, and HTC before
The OS' store is it's only "downside"If you want the most customization and apps and are familiar with using smartphones get an android, as many techies prefer
If you want apps and a friendly user experience get an Apple
If you want a friendly experience, customization, and phone that you can easily transition from your computer, tablet, etc to, then get a Windows
This is a great phone with amazing software but a sub par store

FAst shipment and phone was even better than described
 Very very happy ty




Great and efficient service from seller
 Great price and product as well


Toma las fotos espectacular
great
Great Phone, for grat Price
 With a software change you can update it to windows 10 mobile
 Which makes this buy even better
 Totally happy with this phone
 Totally recomended
 And must be a phone for a person who wants great for less

I need please respond my request, the phone purchased with you NOT work , is locked and I could not use it

Excellent

Everything ok
Very user friendly

The phone is excellent,I really loved it
Perfecto condition, great price

my 1st smart phone
 still learning it
 Had to get a SIM card for it so add that price above the price of the phone
 Lets you chose which carrier you want to go with

What I received was a 640 LTE RM-1073 - Not a RM-1072 -- As was advertised
Worse yet - It was (and still is) - Locked to AT&T - Not unlocked -- As was advertised
While it's true that the instructions and code were provided
 Taped to box
The fact that it was advertised as UNLOCKED, when it clearly is not UNLOCKED 
That the phone was unlocked, is an important selling point to many people
Some people don't have a clue, as to how to proceed
 They're not techies
I'm on the fence, as to returning it or not
1
 So now I have to research, the differencebetween RM-1072 option (should have been)and the RM-1073 (which is what I received)
2
 Then I can spent some time, entering20-digit numbers - yes, 20-digit 
 It's easyenough to mess-up and have to start over


 several times
3
 I need to supply a non-at&t SIM for theunlock process
 Any non-AT&T SIM -That is the right size, physically
 Thereare 3 sizes
 All 3 sizes usually come ona credit-card size card
 You cut-out orpunch out the correct size SIM
 Youmay need a "SIM punch" ($5 - $7)
Accurate cutting ir required 
Order the non-att&t SIM card, from Amazon
They're only $
01 
 - No shipping fee 
Some even come with free goodies
(a bag from metro, etc
)
 Deliverry timeis 2 to 3 days
And that's why I wanted an UNLOCKED PHONE 



 damnit 


Phone arrived one day early
I was sold a phone locked with a key impossible to remove
I just got my new phone, so far things are going very well
 It was so easy to set up, AT&T was very helpful with navigating me through everything
 I still have a lot to learn with all of the features that this phone offers, though I feel this phone is going to fit my lifestyle very well

The camera on this phone is the best camera I have ever seen
 I can easily say that the camera is better than the camera I have on my Galaxy s6 edge + for sure

good phone same as the lumia 720 but needs app to be able to download the arlo security system too view my cameras
The phone is really nice
 I feel very comfortable with it
 The OS is reliable, stable, very easy to use, and the battery life is pretty decent
 Also, the unlock code was really easy to find
 The phone works correctly in worldwide carriers, Panama in my case
 Very satisfied with this product

The phone was not unlocked as was stated on the website

 However, the unlock code was on the box without instructions on how to unlock the phone
The phone shutoff for no reason without you pressing any buttons


on a daily basis


 It froze too and i had to reset within 2 days of using


as the power button was not responding


Overall it works great


The battery life is great


The ringer is low on max


Overall sound is loud
Nice phone
 A bit larger and lighter than my previous Nokia 920 Lumina
 The only downside is the 8GB internal memory, which I hope can be compensated with an SDHC memory card

It's a good phone and well worth the price
 It just has some minor problems
There are some really bad pre-installed apps that you can't delete (FM Radio, Internet Explorer, etc
)
 You can counter this by choosing custom apps in the store, however Windows doesn't have nearly the same selection/variety that Android Smartphones have
Microsoft Office is really good on the go for those moments a burst of inspiration one might get without having a pen and paper available to jot down ideas
 There is also OneDrive storage available for any of your file needs--Or you can insert a Micro SD of your choosing
 Nearly half of the phone's 8GB storage is used on system files
Had no problems using the phone/messaging programs
 Make sure you read the details about which companies are suitable for it
 CDMA networks don't work with this phone (Verizon, T-Mobile)

good
Althoug it says it works perfectly on 900 and 1800 MHz, it doesn't
 It has the same glitches I used to have on my 520
 A lot of apps that crash or that don't work correctly
 Other than that the product was brand new and the unlock code worked perfectly
 This just might be the last Windows Phone I ever have

excellent
Arrived slightly after it should, but good
 Was unlocked so no need for the code
 These phones are fantastic and 4G LTE is correct frequency for a number of countries, New Zealand being one
 Where else can you get one of the best smart phones for the price
 My children all have one and with Windows 10, it works well with their college Lap Tops

gr8t phone
 camed unlocked
 slapped in SIM and ready to go

 micro SIM
My goodness

 Super low quality and if I could give it a zero, I def would
Stat away


Nice cellphone, I received it in excellent condition and it has great price

Great no complaints, nice and smooth workig phone, box was opend, this was done so they can unlock the phone for you, seller explained this in discription
Best as quality
Worked perfectly in Asia
 Just add a local SIM card
Yeah love this phone and its camera
 Nice having a bigger screen without forking out for a Samsung or Iphone (shows my age im so cheap


)
 Bought the Body Glove phone protector for it
 Make sure you get the screen protector for it too though as is easy to scratch the big screen if your a male
 This phone cost $299 in NZ for the same single sim model

It arrived in four days and it works
 But the title of the phone is somewhat misleading, it didn't say it is a ATT go phone
 If I knew, I could gets it for $79 from the Microsoft Store

A really really good phone

Impressive budget phone, we family all love it
Great product and service


I am very happy with this phone
 The size is just right for me, the screen is bright and sharp

Great Microsoft phone
 Can't beat the price
 Camera quality is not great, but certainly not worse than say the Galaxy Avant or Galaxy SIII Mini, which cost more than this and have far worse and smaller screens

Very please with this phone

I love this phone, its not that fast although its speed did not seem to decrease when several apps were opened but it has a good camera and takes decent photos in low light and good quality video with sufficient ambient light present
 Unlocks to any gsm carrier, i cut my sim card to the size of a micro-sim and no issues
 good built in storage, no issue running Skype (pre installed) and whatsapp
 the WiFi can be buggy at times, I had to delete passwords and restart the phone sometimes to connect to WiFi networks but apart from this, all round good phone
 It has fallen a few times and this has not affected its performance - typical durable Nokia phone build although Microsoft no longer puts Nokia on its phones

Working well so far

Good phone
Excelente
Very good telephone
 Convenient price
 I used as my 2nd telephoneSummary:Pros:+ nice 4" screen same iphone 6+ good response speed in functions+ Most of the needed apps available (watsap, skype, tunein, twitter, etc, )+ with w8
1 sync with icloud is transparent creating just the icloud email accout+ Price
 high hardware at low cost+ same configuration screens as our Windows pc's (for a telephone)+ Accept W10 Mobile+ Good recepetion, speed, functionsCons:- With W10 not working sync with icloud anymore- some not common apps no available (i
e
 Nut , cozmo)- vpn configuration block the telephone functions and not working (ppt, l2tp)-
The phone is unlocked but it asking me the protective recovery code i don't know where i can get the recovery code for this phone
Supposed to
 Be an unlocked phone it was a at&t phone but nice phone
So far very impressed
 The phone was unlocked
Overall it works great


The battery life is pretty decent
This cellphone is perfect for me
Great and efficient service from seller
 Totally recomended

good
Works great, good value if you aint tryna drop tons of money to get a smartphone

A very good phone that is even easy to use

As a first time smart phone user, this phone is perfect for me
 Similar to my computer, easy to figure out, not expensive
 It doesn't have access to as many apps as an Apple or Android device, if that is important to you
 For me, it's a great fit

A good product value for money and with latest technology 4G Which is just launched in india
Can not beat the price it's worth it
Its good
Amazing phone

 Switched my SIM card and it fired right up

 Love this phone

Nice

excellent little phone
arrives late, NO usb cord going from phone to pc
 NO guide book let for phone
 The box said everything inside and most important stuffs are missing/
Love this phone
 No sticking, moves quickly enough, slim and pretty
 Bought this phone month ago and have no regrets

The price is very good, but if you've ever used an iPhone you won't be satisfied with Windows OS
If you want to use it as a second phone or hotspot you're good to go
 Wouldn't recommend it as your primary though
bunch of crap
Good product, if you are on Microsoft's platform

Great phone
 Camera is fantastic
 Tile user interface allows the user to quickly see information such as news, weather etc
 without opening the app
 It also runs very smoothly
 I also like the feature where it shows very short clip when you view the picture you take
 The iris scanning to access the phone without entering the PIN is cool (need to 'train' it in various lighting conditions to improve the recognition, however)
 Great phone if you don't need all the apps

The best phone that I have had
 Excellent camare, excelent design I'm so happy
ok
Everything is good with this device except for the battery it dies in just under two hours if I am playing music
 I upgraded from a Lumia 640XL which is a 3000mAh and this Lumia 950XL I k ow has a 3300 or higher mAh and it takes forever to charge for it to die quick
 Even when not in use it dies I have to constantly have charging
 I am very disappointed in this device I hate Android and ios have no choice but to get rid of this one and go back to my 640xl
The camera is astounding, Windows 10 mobile is a great os
i love it
I'm a windows phone fan
They features fits me perfectly

Are amazing



Good product
Looks, cost and user friendly appeal is second to none

I've been using this international version on the AT&T network in the United States
 There was some initial issues with getting the settings correct for sending and receiving text messages, but once I got those figured out, it's been a perfect phone
 Battery life is beyond excellent, and the phone runs very smooth on the most updated Windows 10 software (build 10
0
14393
67 as of those review)
 There is no lag in any app I've ran and the camera is beyond wonderful
 I cannot reccomend this phone more for any Windows phone fan or for someone who's just looking for a change
 Top notch


For FYI, if you're having similar issues on the AT&T network in the US with text messaging, here is the settings you need to input
Internet APN is just Defulat APN
 Works FineMMS APN is as follows
Profile Name: NXTGENPHONEAPN: NXTGENPHONEUser Name: None (leave blank)Password: None (leave blank)Type of Sign-In Info: None (leave blank)IP Type: IPv4v6Proxy Server: proxy

Good

Perfect
 Works perfectly



Works perfectly in Greece and a very good product
 Sorry I am a Windows lover with a good product

Perfect
Still a newbie, but great so far with only few points missing iphone
I heard all the horror stories about how sorry this phone was every since it came out
 I bought this phone off the fact it seem like it would be a phone that was functional and useful beyond just talking and chatting
 Also I'm already invested in the Microsoft eco system
 Right out the box with out changing any settings, I was using my phone for a good bit
 From 7:30am to about 8pm with just talking, texting, and playing games at work
 I found the apps were satisfactory
 I was able to find apps that did what I needed them to do
 I do love the camera on this phone
 I'm not what I call a picture taker by I find myself taking way more pictures than my last two smartphones
 I also was able to upgrade the software right out the box I don't know if that's because I'm in South Korea
 But I'm definitely loving my phone and would recommend this phone to anyone interested in a good windows phone
 I did not try out Continuum yet

The phone is great, brought to Brazil, the best camera I had, and overall system is way faster then my old 640xl

I bought this for my mom because she doesn't like Smartphones, and this is the perfect cellphone for her
 Recommended

actual phone too smallwhile I checked the details before purchase, the actual phone was small ( too small) for me
the return efforts are not worth it
 I would rather make a gift of the phone to a younger personwho can better handle this size of a mobile phone
Ok, the good: 1) It's compact and I love slider phones that cover up the keyboardAnd the bad: 1) It was a pain in the butt to figure out the configurations to get the mms to work, but that's part of getting an unlocked phone2) Every time I use the text to send to an email, the phone turns off and restarts3) The keyboard buttons are pretty flat & are close together so it's easy to hit the wrong button4) The camera quality is crap, but you can't really expect much from a phone like this5) The alarm feature worked like once
 It hasn't gone off at the time I programmed ever since
The reason why I gave full star is the customer service of Nokia company in USA
 the phone is stylish
 The product is good and has fabulous battery power
 I use phone whole day for talking and change still is up
 It's good feature compare to big screen smartphone that leak on charge
If you talk a lot over the phone and tired of phone out charge then you choice has to be this phone

Excelente
 los recomiendo 100%, el envío fue rápido, el articulo llego tal cual fue descrito en las características del producto

 Compra realizada desde Venezuela


Windows is the greatest tbh
Love


LOve



LOVe


LOVE this phone





 It is absolutely amazing

 Very advanced and the touch response is very quick
 I love the size of the screen and the actual size of the phone
 It's pretty huge but the phone could actually fit in your pocket (a good size deep pocket)
 2 drawbacks are: Sound could be louder when playing music from the phone's music app and 2nd, camera could be better


but in regards to the latter statement, I believe you can download any type of camera u want and use the downloaded camera for photos instead of the default camera

Works excellently
 I bought two, one for myself and one for my wife and I must say it has worked well so far

I bought this phone a few months ago, and I love it
 It has decent processing power, a nice big screen, and a great battery life for a smartphone (3 days
)
The catch: If you're in the US, you're not going to get LTE (4G) coverage
 This is the 'international' version of the phone, it picks up LTE bands that are more commonly used in Asian and European carriers
 As it happens, no US-based carriers use any of these bands
 And currently only AT&T shares a hsdpa (3G) band with it
 Fortunately, 2G is pretty easy to get
 But don't expect great internet speed on this in the US

I loved it for the first few daysthen camera just diedI googled and found that it is common software problem with Lumia and Windows - automatic windows upgrade kills your camera; inserting storage card kills our camera
 Solutions are not to use a storage cart and downgrade windows to previous version; and sometimes it resolve the problem
 Neither worked for me
 So I have a very nice phone but without camera; I still have hope that Nokia and Microsoft will address it one day



Phone is great
 Everything I expected

Love it

sper
It's up and running and I hope to have for sometime

I bought it in March and it lasted less then two months
 It wasn't dropped, put in water or exposed to anything
 Just wont turn on

Its ok for a used phone, but you have to update it

Package was opened and seal broken
 Would give error: not enough memory"
Slow connection, bad reception


back it went

When the phone arrived, I was excited, it is a beautiful but am disappointed with how it restarts even when a call is in progress
 It also gets extremely hot when in use
 When updating, it has to be hard reset because it freezes and goes dead
 This is not I paid lots of money for
 Very disappointing

Good fone oh
Great



Ok
Lobe the windows phones, but not enough apps supported
 I had to get an android just to be able to do banking
 And this model lumia is clunky and broke within a couple of months
Wonderful phone
 Great specs and very easy to learn
 Beautiful and responsive and big screen
 Very fast
 Wonderful operating system
Good
I am totally satisfied with the phone
 It look so sleek, and good
 My family also love it so much my son just bought the same phone

EXCELLENT phone I love it

Grate phone it works wonderfulwhen I bring it to my country Jamaica I just put the sim in it only thing it use a mini sin card but I love it
sent it back because get started problem downloading apps
It's great 


I recently answered a question on whether the phone I bought was a clone or prefab
 It is not a Nokia Android clone of the Windows8 OS
 If it is a prefab, I don't know
 As I stated in the response, I thought Nokia manufactured their phones in Sweden not in Hong Kong
 Probably assembled in China and distributed to the International market out of Hong Kong
 The phone was preconfigured for the Hong Kong Market
 Though it was in Hong Kong English, it was easy enough to reset the phone without losing the app bundle it came with
 Apps were enough for video+music, camera, a driving navigator, a walking map, public transit, some Nokia proprietary apps that work well; like the panoramic camera app that stiches together about 4 pictures
 The Mobile office suite excel, power point and word, with office 365 to sync with your other MS Office software
 I had to install a third party file manager app to access files on my SD card
 8 gigs onboard mem is ok
 Though if you want to save maps directly to the onboard mem, memory be eaten up fast
 I loaded about 7 apps and have 2
68 gigs left
 I mentioned that maps, because even though I asked the maps to load to the SD card, they did not
 I was happy they didn't, because transferring the SD card from my phone to my tablet, corrupted the data
 I doubt it was an issue with the phone
 However, I was overseas and needed the maps, and was thankful that they were on the phone's memory
 The phone arrived about a week before the "no later than date" which was about 3 weeks
 I am rating this particular purchase at three stars for 3 reasons
 First, the phone has a black back case and not red, as requested
 Sounds trivial, but I wonder what else was not "as advertised"
 For example, at the vendor you will get the latest OS with the latest bundle
 I got Windows 8
0, where at the vendor, the phone was loaded with Windows 8
1
 Maybe not a big deal until I actually ask to upgrade the OS
 Second, the phone runs hot when browsing the internet and also using GPS actively (GPS when in flight mode)
 So I wonder about the CPU
 It is a 1
7 dual core, but so is my tablet that doesn't run hot (significantly hot)
 I wonder if the phone is a prefab or if the chip is overclocked (inferior chip running faster than advised) to save on money
 Third, the initial price was attractive at about $277, but after paying $23 to ship to an FPO AE, the savings of purchasing online didn't really outweigh the peace of mind of purchasing the same phone at a local vendor, where I can walk over and have it serviced or returned immediately if necessary
 I would have paid $70 more at the local vendor
 The battery life is decent lasting a whole day with some web browsing, watching around 1
5hrs of video, using the GPS and a few short phone calls
 When I did notice the phone getting hot, it did consume more battery life that usual
 I was slightly worried that the G4 standard here in Italy would not be compatible with the frequency published, but it works great
 Sometimes a webpage will hang, other times pages will pop right up
 The webpages hanging are starting to get annoying
 The Windows8 interface for me is a breath of fresh air compared the Android OSs that I use on my Samsung tablets
 I find the interface to be simpler and quicker for that matter

Amazing phone 

Got the phone today and was excited and irritated all at the same time
 This is indeed an international phone the wall adapter that came with my phone is NOT for the USA
 I am glad I have a number of usb wall adaptors that seem to do the trick
 The instruction book and default settings are for HONG KONG though easy enough to go through the setup and make changes
 The default back on the phone I received was black, not red as in the picture, but I am ok with that
 The box arrived quickly and it was obvious that, while new, this had been open and a simple piece of regular tape was over the end and the bag on the phone was fingerprinted up, though I can not tell anything is wrong and the phone seems to work great both on wifi, and over the data from my provider
Overall glad I got this phone but just be aware that you will need a USB wall adaptor that is for USA if you live here

I have for more of 5 months this device and works very very well, Previously I had a android phone and didn't work like this, I had a lot issues with my older android device; this item have a nice performace with a real functional aplications
 I am happy with this Windowsphone

This phone arrived fast fast great company
 Took me 45 minutes to adjust to window based phone
 Once I got it I love it
 I don't know about pixels and all the criticism about camera but to me this phone is great phone great
 Camera looks good to me
 Plus it reminds me of things operates with voice commands good
 But its a large phone
 I have large hands no problem for me how ever it could be issue for some people
awful cell phone




 worst camera ever, there is nothing in the app market compared to Google Play




 boring interface, could not use it more than a month

This is an amazing phone
 Windows phone 8
1 OS is very easy to use, and has a rather large selection of apps in the Microsoft app store
 The phone runs very quickly and has an amazing battery life
 Very satisfied with this purchase

The seller offered a Nokia 1320 model RM-994 but he sent me the RM-996_APAC_Vietnam_200 version, this version is not adjusted to work properly in Latin American countries, I can't even configure it in Spanish because this version is not designed to work with this language
 This version is designed for Asian countries
 Aditionally the phone often freezes and has an overheat problem
 I'm really disappointed with my purchase since I choose this product because of the high reputation and the positive review from the seller and I expected to get a fully functional phone (as the RM-994 that he published does) but instead I got this phone that I can't even use properly

i really like this phone, be reeeeeally sure you want a reaaally big phone before purchase because it is huge

I Love it

It was just perfect

Please note, this will not work with TMO's 4G in the US
I have no regrets
Very good

Works perfect
 Amazing experience on Windows Phone 8
1, a must buy it you are familiarized with the OS
Nice price for a heavy duty Phablet

I have no problem with it its a great phone
This phone has no volume

This was a fraudulent sale I have ever experienced
 I was told that the phone works with T mobile 4g but it realm doesn't
 Anyone intending to buy this phone please don't
 I would advise you to buy the Lumia 1320 rm995
 That's the one which works with t mobile not this one
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👌EXCELLENT
I give it 1 star because I can't give it a negative 5
 This phone is worse than a flip phone
 I feel like I'm on dial up internet
 It will be chunked in the back of my drawer as of Saturday
 Maybe I will give it to my 5 year old god daughter

Nice phone

This is a wonderful phone for a terrific price
 I love WP8 and needed the larger numbers - this fit the bill exactly and is what I need

This phone is terrific when its working
 Two weeks after receiving it; it powers down by itself often
 Even though its fully charged it is very difficult to get it turned back on
 😒 very frustrating

This phone is great
 I purchased a sim card from straight talk an at&t micro sim
 Once I got my sim and my phone all I needed to figure out was how to set up the apn
 I went on straight talks website and had to get the settings from there
 It took a couple of tries
 I love this phone
 The screen is bright and the app store isn't bad all and all this one helluva great phone
 The camera's on here could be a bit better but they serve their purpose
 Have a charger for this phone cuz the one I got was rounded where the plug goes in
 I already had a charger or that could've been a problem
 I enjoy the Nokia Win 1320 and the size is awesome
 Thanks FGS
😊
Junk
 don't waste your money
 It doesn't turn on never again

It's great

Beside windows 8 and 8
1's store lacking some apps the phone is amazing
 Being mostly an android user, and before this being on iPhone 5, this phone was very easy to get used to
 I loved my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and this phone, if you like large phones, is perfect
 Not as big as the Sony Xperia Z Ultra, which is a little too big, but nicely larger then the note 2
 The home screen is a little weird to get used too if you are not used to windows 8 on a computer or tablet, but it becomes very handy as you get to choose what you want on the home screen and what you dont want, plus you get to pick from a nice group of colors for your theme
 The app drawer when you swipe left is great with a nice search list
 The 720p screen isn't as bad as people think, everyone thinks its all about pixels, but you can get nice crisp 720p screens, just like this phone has
 With Nokia Black colors on this phone stand out and you get great viewing angles and outside the screen is just as nice, Nokia has done great with there black screen technology
 Another thing Nokia has done well is built this phone, but Nokia has a great reputation and builds all there phones like mini tanks

 They also have great battery life
 The only minor downfall of Windows Phone is the small lack of apps and games, but the store is growing everyday so that shouldn't last long
Pros: -Build Quality -Large crisp screen -Windows Phone is a great android alternative, especially since its growing and growing everyday
* -Batter Life, can get 2+ days with moderate use, 1 to 1 1/2 days with heaver use
 -Camera button, i love having the separate button for just the camera
Cons: -Windows Phone, at the time of this review, lacks some games and apps that android has
Overall i would recommend this phone to anyone who wants a break from android or just wants a whole new experience with this great phone
 Coming from IOS to this was a great change and i would have to say, between android and WP8 i would have to say with WP growing and growing WP8 has to be my new favorite OS


When I decided to purchase this phone it was mainly to avoid a new contract
 After using it I this its better than many of the new flagship phones
 It may not be as fast, but the screen size means I really don't need a tablet
 I have big hands so the size is right for me
 It will be too big for people with small hands
 It is also able to run the new update to windows phone 8
1 when it comes out
 Works just fine one AT&T but not at LTE speeds

My friend didn't like it because it won't support by most app that is the reson give the phone only one star
Well first I am a person who makes a review after a good couple of weeks of using it and in this case it was well over a couple of months
 Also, I am very computer savvy person (if you know what I mean


)It is fast smooth and certainly feels like a great phone
 The main downsides are that its an international version (thus does not work with 4G or LTE or 3G for that fact) but it still works with 2G (note: I use T-Mobile)
 Now I know there is a variant of a United States model of this phone which is called the RM-995 model version and that is another $100 more than this one (I bought this one for $350)
 Now I know its not fair to judge a phone because of its these kinds of limitation but the loss of a "star" is because of the lack of support from the company when I asked it some simple questions (such as does this work for T-Mobile and does 4G/LTE/3G work)


but over all it is an awesome phone and I do not regret my decision buying this phone

I'm satisfied with my purchase, thank you

Update: I bought this phone about two weeks ago, turns out that the phone has a nice feel, looks brilliant, and works fine except for the flash and the volume up button that would not work
 At the end, I would recommend this seller to the World
 Their communication was superb, and fast, they sent me a replacement with no questions asked
 I give this phone five stars because for the price, who could look for a better deal

wasn't impressed as I thought I'd be and it was rather small for what the reviews said

Dear Customer Service, I bought this phone (Nokia Lumia 1320) in February this year
 I have not enjoyed using it because it has internet connection problems since i got it from you
 It has always displayed connection problems hence not user-friendly
 I have since stopped using it
 I would like to know if there is something you can do about my case
 Thankyou
Excellent
Good phone but after about a month the battery overheats constantly and phone starts acting wacky



Second try: Even though I returned the first one, I thought I would try ordering this phone again because I still wanted it and have all the accessories I purchased for the first one
 I am happy to report that I actually received the International version (RM-994) and not the Chinese version
 This phone actually connected to T-Mobile and my Internet account without issue
 I have been using the phone for several hours now without the unusual heating up that happened with the original purchase
 I'll update this if anything crazy happens, but so far I am a happy camper
 Warning for other interested buyers, make sure you get the correct version
Original:Within the first two days I've had this phone, I've encountered a few problems
 First, the phone I received is not the "International version" and is instead the Chinese version (RM-994 vs RM-996)
 This seems to remove LTE and 4G capabilities
 For unknown reasons, the phone became HOT when I was trying to figure out how to set up my network
 It would also shut off randomly
 A factory reset fixed that issue, but seeing as how it's a Chinese phone, it rebooted back in Chinese
 I had to figure out how to get it back to English while also trying to get it past the factory reset instructions
 After that, I still could not get it to access the network even after I went through troubleshooting with a tech for hours
 During the last attempt, the phone stopped charging
 I tried to wiggle the cord, remove it and reinsert it, and plugged other phones and tablets into the charger (which all charged)
 After that, I decided to be done
 I know this phone has great capabilities, but the one I received was a lemon
 I am returning it

This by far my best purchase on Amazon
 I returned a few phones I bought but the Nokia Lumia 1320 unlocked gsm is a keeper
 Order arrived two days later (free shipping),battery last for days, great camera and able to download free cool apps
 I recommend this phone to anyone ,you won't regret purchasing it

the phone cuts on and off, but without a warranty there is nothing you can do
Nice phone but can't get it to stay connected to carrier it's suppose to b 4g LTE signal comes and goes
Fast windows with excellent camera
 Looks beautiful
 But windows is still to evolve
 I hope they will come up with better app store soon and more customizable options soon

I got the phone at said time love the big screen but the charger looks so cheap but I don't no if is unlocked because I bought for someone will buy more stuff from this seller and is very heavy phone 

Tx
 Good product and great deal
Great phone
 Screen is great, and procesor speed and perfomance is wondefull

I love my Nokia phone works better than I expected 
You don't have to charge everyday every 2 days 
The apps are awesome I would recommend this phone to any one to buy

nice big screen, a little too big, but it works great
Love this phone was on time and easy to set up
Great experience, nothing was wrong great experience

Waste of money and time
 Phone does not run on 4g
 This model (rm-994) only gets up to edge signal
 Video streaming is basically non existent
 Web pages take minutes to load
 If you live in north America this phone is as use full as a house phone
 Buyer beware



As far as windows phones go this is one of the best for a budget

 I did soon discover that, despite my large hands, this phone is too large for me
 I didn't want to remove a star because that is subjective
 Fast, beautiful display, and windows os is great for people who aren't super app dependent
 it's efficient

awful cell phone




 worst camera ever, there is nothing in the app market compared to Google Play




 boring interface, could not use it more than a month

 Everything I expected

Love it

sper
It's up and running and I hope to have for sometime

I bought it in March and it lasted less then two months
 It wasn't dropped, put in water or exposed to anything
 Just wont turn on

I am totally satisfied with the phone
 It look so sleek, and good
 My family also love it so much my son just bought the same phone

EXCELLENT phone I love it

Grate phone it works wonderfulwhen I bring it to my country Jamaica I just put the sim in it only thing it use a mini sin card but I love it
sent it back because get started problem downloading apps
It's great 


I recently answered a question on whether the phone I bought was a clone or prefab
 It is not a Nokia Android clone of the Windows8 OS
 If it is a prefab, I don't know
 As I stated in the response, I thought Nokia manufactured their phones in Sweden not in Hong Kong
 Probably assembled in China and distributed to the International market out of Hong Kong
 The phone was preconfigured for the Hong Kong Market
 Though it was in Hong Kong English, it was easy enough to reset the phone without losing the app bundle it came with
 Apps were enough for video+music, camera, a driving navigator, a walking map, public transit, some Nokia proprietary apps that work well; like the panoramic camera app that stiches together about 4 pictures
 The Mobile office suite excel, power point and word, with office 365 to sync with your other MS Office software
 I had to install a third party file manager app to access files on my SD card
 8 gigs onboard mem is ok
 Though if you want to save maps directly to the onboard mem, memory be eaten up fast
 I loaded about 7 apps and have 2
68 gigs left
 I mentioned that maps, because even though I asked the maps to load to the SD card, they did not
 I was happy they didn't, because transferring the SD card from my phone to my tablet, corrupted the data
 I doubt it was an issue with the phone
 However, I was overseas and needed the maps, and was thankful that they were on the phone's memory
 The phone arrived about a week before the "no later than date" which was about 3 weeks
 I am rating this particular purchase at three stars for 3 reasons
 First, the phone has a black back case and not red, as requested
 Sounds trivial, but I wonder what else was not "as advertised"
 For example, at the vendor you will get the latest OS with the latest bundle
 I got Windows 8
0, where at the vendor, the phone was loaded with Windows 8
1
 Maybe not a big deal until I actually ask to upgrade the OS
 Second, the phone runs hot when browsing the internet and also using GPS actively (GPS when in flight mode)
 So I wonder about the CPU
 It is a 1
7 dual core, but so is my tablet that doesn't run hot (significantly hot)
 I wonder if the phone is a prefab or if the chip is overclocked (inferior chip running faster than advised) to save on money
 Third, the initial price was attractive at about $277, but after paying $23 to ship to an FPO AE, the savings of purchasing online didn't really outweigh the peace of mind of purchasing the same phone at a local vendor, where I can walk over and have it serviced or returned immediately if necessary
 I would have paid $70 more at the local vendor
 The battery life is decent lasting a whole day with some web browsing, watching around 1
5hrs of video, using the GPS and a few short phone calls
 When I did notice the phone getting hot, it did consume more battery life that usual
 I was slightly worried that the G4 standard here in Italy would not be compatible with the frequency published, but it works great
 Sometimes a webpage will hang, other times pages will pop right up
 The webpages hanging are starting to get annoying
 The Windows8 interface for me is a breath of fresh air compared the Android OSs that I use on my Samsung tablets
 I find the interface to be simpler and quicker for that matter

Amazing phone 

Got the phone today and was excited and irritated all at the same time
 This is indeed an international phone the wall adapter that came with my phone is NOT for the USA
 I am glad I have a number of usb wall adaptors that seem to do the trick
 The instruction book and default settings are for HONG KONG though easy enough to go through the setup and make changes
 The default back on the phone I received was black, not red as in the picture, but I am ok with that
 The box arrived quickly and it was obvious that, while new, this had been open and a simple piece of regular tape was over the end and the bag on the phone was fingerprinted up, though I can not tell anything is wrong and the phone seems to work great both on wifi, and over the data from my provider
Overall glad I got this phone but just be aware that you will need a USB wall adaptor that is for USA if you live here

I have for more of 5 months this device and works very very well, Previously I had a android phone and didn't work like this, I had a lot issues with my older android device; this item have a nice performace with a real functional aplications
 I am happy with this Windowsphone

This phone arrived fast fast great company
 Took me 45 minutes to adjust to window based phone
 Once I got it I love it
 I don't know about pixels and all the criticism about camera but to me this phone is great phone great
 Camera looks good to me
 Plus it reminds me of things operates with voice commands good
 But its a large phone
 I have large hands no problem for me how ever it could be issue for some people
Its ok for a used phone, but you have to update it

Package was opened and seal broken
 Would give error: not enough memory"
Slow connection, bad reception


back it went

When the phone arrived, I was excited, it is a beautiful but am disappointed with how it restarts even when a call is in progress
 It also gets extremely hot when in use
 When updating, it has to be hard reset because it freezes and goes dead
 This is not I paid lots of money for
 Very disappointing

Good fone oh
Great



Ok
Lobe the windows phones, but not enough apps supported
 I had to get an android just to be able to do banking
 And this model lumia is clunky and broke within a couple of months
Wonderful phone
 Great specs and very easy to learn
 Beautiful and responsive and big screen
 Very fast
 Wonderful operating system
Good
Thanks and good agent
the phone was not newit is used 

Good phone i like it its old but nice not bad but i edvice eny1 dont bay it h h
Within its limits its a very capable little device
 It's very inexpensive, the battery lasts incredibly long, the voice clarity is great, and it has excellent reception
 Back in 2003-2007 this device would have been a bestseller
 After breaking my smartphone I bought this as a backup,
It is a less-tan-30-dollar-non-contract-phone
 What can you say
 Perfect for Water White and Jessie Pinkman

Very light phone good for Sameone who is not into smart phones
GREAT tough little backup phone to have around when your fragile smartphone breaks
 Battery lasts for days
 No camera, bluetooth or pc connectivity, but you can make calls and text
 Also has an FM radio on it, but unfortunately you can't use just the radio without a sim card in it

So far it's a decent phone
 I've owned similar Nokia phones for several years now and they have always been very reliable
 For ~$26, I don't want to be overly critical but I do wish the call quality were better
 I read a lot of rave reviews prior to purchasing and almost all of the reviews mentioned great call quality but that has not been my experience
 My previous phone was a Nokia Xpress Music (old school
) and the call quality on that phone was always good so I don't think it's me
It came with a headphone set
 My ears tend to be on the larger size and I still found the ear buds to be too large
Pros:Inexpensive
Decent battery life (several days even after making multiple calls)You won't ever be caught ignoring your kids staring at a smart phone all day
Cons:Fair to mediocre call qualityNo Bluetooth capabilityEar buds are largeIf you have never owned a Nokia, be sure to read the instruction manual
 I was used to having buttons on the side of the phone to adjust the volume
 It took me a while to figure out the volume is adjusted only while in-call by using the left and right joystick button

Cheaply made
 No worth calling it a cell phone

We got two of these as backup phones during our family trip to the UK
 Excellent battery life
 Reception and voice is clear too
 We dropped them on numerous occasions accidentally, but this phone is ruf-n-tuf
 Well done Nokia

The simpler the better
 No problem at all with this phone

Great item
 It work really well for what I paid for

Simple yet excellent for those in need of just a basic phone to text and call

good
I took this phone to India and where its not working
 This has been advertised as GSM but not working as advertised

👍
Doesn't work at all
Didn't come with a SIM card

This phone is a waste
 Dont buy this phone
 Not working with any simcard

Bought this for my dad who has no interest in a smart phone or anything fancy
 Overall he says he is happy with it for its battery life and decent sized screen (an upgrade from his previous phone)
 Things that could have been better:1) dedicated volume buttons (although this might not be feasible at this price point)2) this phone comes with a flashlight mode that can be activated with the right nav-button combo
 My dad has found himself accidentally turning it on on at least a few occasions, causing unnecessary battery drain

Excelente

the phone did not charge up at all
 it was a waste of money
A solid dumb phone with possibly the longest battery life in its class; other people take its lack of camera and basic web functionality as a con but it is getting increasingly difficult to find a dumb phone with NO frills
 Well, there are some low-tech ones: a pretty functional LED light, an FM radio, and a changeable back plate that is supposed to come in different colors
 The only direct competitor that I have found is the Samsung Keystone 2, and while that phone has a better form factor (no one has mentioned that this phone is large) this one has the better interface
 SMS storage is very limited, even by burner-phone standards

That's what I needed: a simple phone which cannot connect to the Internet at all
 Excellent for using in an international trip when a data roaming costs much money

I bought this phone so that I could have a phone with no internet, as partial "unplug" thing
 It works great, although there are a few drawbacks
 It has a very small SMS memory, so the inbox fills up pretty quickly
 It doesn't have a way to auto-delete oldest first, so you have to either delete everything, including your newest messages, or individually delete each older message, which gets time consuming
 I text a lot, so that's a big annoyance for me
I also wish that you could send it a picture via MMS (since there's no data port and no internet, that leaves only MMS) to set as a background picture
 Alas, it doesn't handle MMS at all
 That also makes receiving group messages nearly impossible, as most smartphones send group messages as MMS instead of SMS
Call quality is pretty good though, and it came with a handsfree wired (it doesn't have bluetooth) headset
The SIM tray is easy to use; because it is a tray, not a slot, I was able to insert the micro-SIM from my smartphone without any trouble
Battery life is excellent
 I took this on a business trip for two weeks, using it to text and talk for a couple hours each day, and only had to charge it a few times

Loved the phone
The Nokia 106 works well enough
 I used a AT&T prepaid sim card for service
 I only have to charge it once a week with low usage
 My only issue is that it does not receive group text message, but I knew that from reading the other reviews
 Would recommend if all you need is a phone to call and text on

quick shipmentgood value
Exclent


Excellent

It is not unlocked
It didn't worked as expected neither
 We take it to a technical services and they told us that it didn't work with our sim card because probably the cell phone recive a strong stroke or it was expose to humidity
not opened to my network so I am unable to use it
Nice
Excelente
excelente
Awesome
Telephone device is ok, but i give 3 stars because the box came open
EXCELENTE
I love it

muy bueno
Great
good
 battery can use 5 days

This is my 2nd Nokia 106GSM cell phone
 I sent one back, because it took too long to connect to the provider which could be very dangerous if there is an emergency
 The one I kept also takes awhile to connect, after the phone is turned on, the times varies for a connection
 I am turning the phone on and off periodically to see how long, it will take for the phone to connect
 It seems to take at least one to five min
for connectionI read the reviews, but did not find any problems with the connection
 I would not purchase this item again, not reliable

Hi,I would like to inform that I have received the phone but It's UNLOCKED



Pretty cheaply made phone
 Poor sound quality and very garbled
Works as advertised, thank you

The product is not working in India

its waste of money as mobile does not pickup gsm tower signal

its ok is what i was looking for my dad very basic phone because he only use it to make phone calls no need an smart phone
Very good for text for my disabled sister and my mom

Dear Sir/Madam - we are trying to use this phone in Nepal
 We fully charged the battery, put the GSM Sim inside but it is not working
 Please do let me know what we need to do here

Unable to use phone on current plan

Nostalgia

bad
Genial
This phone is advertised as being unlocked but it is not


 Avoid

Good small basic phone
 Good sound, plenty loud voice and ringer
 Great battery life
 Screen could be brighter

excelente producto, 100% recomendado
Worked well
 Quick delivery

excellente
love it



I bought this for my dad who only knows how to call
 It's a pretty basic phone
 And it worked for T-Mobile, so I don't know why other people are saying it's locked

excellent
All very good, responsible and punctual, I recommend 100%
I took the phone to Brazil and it would only work with one sim card
 The sim card that had worked in other phones
 Could not get any signal, zero bars
 I was not happy

Excellent
goob
I purchased this for my 12 year old son
 He really enjoys the radio feature
 It was very quick and easy trip to the cell phone store to setup

Item was as described
 Thanks
DOesn't work with T-mobile

Nice cellphone

Very satisfied
Since stole me my excellent Nokia, I decided on this model that can talk, answer, read, and write
 The cell works fine
 I agree

no chinese characters in this phone

Veri good
Solid and simple
Nice and simple basic phone with good battery capacity
I saw two problems so far: even at maximum volume call is not heard when the phone is in a bag and not very good audibility when talking

Bought it for my non-US SIM card,GSM, it works

You guys cheated both phones are locked
 I spent 20 $ for unlocking
 I need it back
very good and cencillo listen very well to call me I can not fault the product 



Ty

excellent product recommended operating from Venezuela
The description of these phones was that they are unblocked and work on a GSM next work
 When they arrived in Zimbabwe they didn't work
 I don't know if this is common from this company or was this a mistake
 Anyway I'm disappointed and can't use these phones
My mom uses this phone and she is completely satisfied

Horrible this phone will not keep charge and the phone do not pick up signal

Worst phone I ever it won't even take a charger

did not work in garbage
Good
Was unable to used in foreign country
waist of money, was unable to returned product because I did not take package with me

excelente
Tried using a Simcard from Giv
 Didn't work
This phone is very poor quality
 Not recommended

I was not satisfied
 The phone has so many problems with it
 Was unable to dail out you could only talk on the phone with the speaker
 I waited over 3 weeks for the phone and now I am waiting again for a replacement and it looks as if I was charged for the replace that probably have to wait another 4 weeks to receive

The Sim card was not included, and the directions for using it were BAD
 However, the supplier said to return the phone which I will be doing shortly
Sad because I really wanted this phone being a Nokia to work properly

it doesnt work with any GSM SIM Card
 For returning I need to pay the postage on my own

BIG NO NO

Bought as gift
thanks
Good
The phone was not unlocked
 I was very disappointed when I got overseas

good
Phone advertise as unlocked phone, come to find out is not unlocked
Not happy at all
 will be more careful
its okey
This phone is in Chinese
 Can't be activated even at the ATT store
 I paid for nothing
 If I could give zero stars I would

Terrible, didn't have an APN and it won't work in the U
S

Simple GSM works as expected


nothing fancy


display and sound is good
 Easily support any GSM sim worldwide
mine broke in 2 months, that's why I'm asking about warranty
 Nokia is out of business/owned by microsoft


Capability to place an outgoing call quit after about 3 months

Not compatible outside the US

Didn't last too long; but, I really didn't expect it to
 Harder to figure out without any book

Very shoddy
 Broke after less than two weeks use

Phone was purchased for vacation in Italy
 It never worked
 Went to TIM store there and was told phone was NOT unlocked or quad band
 Had to buy a new phone there to be able to call home
 Wasted hours taking care of this


I like it but it is not working at my area
 The phone is not picking the sim card
 I don't know if it is because of my geographical area
 That is Africa

Manual is in spanish so is the phone it self, so am not pleased
 Product description did not include that info

Good product

When the phone arrived today, my husband and I spent 30-40 minutes trying to open the back cover in order to insert a SIM card
 The instructions say, "press the logo and pull on the top corners
" Pressing the logo did nothing to enable the cover to be taken off
 We finally resorted to using a knife to pry it off, fearing we would break the rather fragile looking plastic
 We succeeded but were ready to return the phone
 Fortunately, one doesn't have to open it often, once the SIM card is in, so we will keep it as a back up to the Samsung which we immediately ordered
 And fortunately, the cost is low and it probably will serve our needs to use it only as an emergency type phone

Good
Works fine
I got the phone on time

 However they said that its unlocked but it could only work with one carrier in jamaica which is Lime i was so dissapointed

 The phone was brand new and every thing was in box

 This is a nice phone

excellent
excelent product, very recomdable

perfect
acceptable and efficient response time
Excelente
Bought it to us in Jamaica on the digicel network but was unable to do so, however, on the LIME network it was great
 If you are just looking for a phone to make and receive calls and text, this is a good one

fine
Returned for connection problems - Still not sure if due to unit or due to carrier
 Sometimes it worked - sometimes not

bueno
Great Phone and Great service
EXACTLY what I ordered and worked perfectly with new sim card
 Quick service too


phone is ok but bigger than i expected
 main issue is that battery is not as advertised, i only use it to send sms messages (few per day) and i need to fully recharge battery after a week

Perfect for a replacement phone

This product was great considering the price
 The only reason i give it a 4 star instead of a star is that it charges using a charger that is not a micro USB, which means if you lose your charger or forget it it may be difficult to find another one as i have not seen this type often ( its a small plug) but other than that functions great and is reliable especially if all you want to do is make calls or text

Omg this phone I send it to jamaica and them said is unlocked but it not and my sister bring it to go get it unlock and is $3500
00 jm$ no way
so my money gone down the drain

This phone is not unlocked as it says
 I first tried it in the USA and did not work
 Then l took it to overseas and still not working with any network
I have even been gone beyond to contact Nokia on it, the company said it does not have the software for this version to unlocked it
The most painful part of this deal is that, the phone is oversea and l can not return it for my money, because l bought it for my MOM in Africa
Never again should any unlocked phones be bought from this vendor
 I have regretted my purchase, l first knew Nokia phones were good brand to be trusted
Thank you

The phone is simple enough but I can change the language that it came in so I basically can not use it

Worked perfectly thank you
Low price does not excuse low sensitivity with low audio to boot
 Cant hold on 2 bars via AT&T 
 Intermittent audio capture etc

 Only thing worse is the weak response from the supplier
 Amazon comes to the rescue


 G
 Perry
It working good thank you very much
As an english speaking man living in the middle of the USA it would have been nice to know it doesnt work here in the USA and is in Portuguese

very nice
this cell phone is for my mother and I have not used it
Nice and simple
 Works well, and I'm not afraid if my kid will lose it (it's cheap anyways)
Lasted about a week before the glass cracked
 I dropped it face down on the table, but my Nokia smartphone has been dropped many times and has yet to be damaged

Arrived in great condition, works as expected
 Good Value for money

The performance matches its price

Like
Horrible
 Didn't even work






All that I expected
 My thanks to the vendor

Excellent basic and low cost phone
 Battery stands for 3 days of heavy use, just making calls

Excelente
If you're looking for a basic phone that does phone calls, this is a great deal
 The price is right and the quality is fine
 It's no iPhone, but for phone calls (remember when phones did that
), the audio quality is excellent, the radio is great (i
e
, lots of "bars"), it's easy to use, and it feels well made
 I got this for my disabled brother, who will never be able to use anything like a touchscreen phone, and it's perfect
 It will do SMS (slowly), but there's no camera, no data, no browser, nothing
 When I went into an AT&T store to get a SIM for it, the guy said "Wow, what's that
 What a great phone
"
Sound is very low
 I can barely hear the person on the phone even when I am in quiet room
 If you try to talk with this phone when you are outside you can hear almost nothing

great phone
Phone doesn't work with old SIM card
 Has to go to AT&T and a get a new one
 Still giving problem occasionally

Serves y purpose
Excelente

Nice cheap knock around but doesn't work in most countries which I've found out sadly after leaving the states to where I live in Mozambique

The title clearly says its unlocked, but when I inserted my sim card it received no signal from my carrier
 I went to the sim card app and it asked me to enter a pin code
 I tried 0000 1234 but no success
 I couldn't use the phone so I'm sending it back
 What a waste of time

Very small
 More for kids

This phone was not unlocked

Batter lasts very long
 Good for a child

I've owned a series of Android phones and finally got exasperated with a computer (way more powerful than the Apollo flight control computer) combined with an afterthought phone
 It takes way too many menus just to MAKE A CALL
 I wanted a PHONE first
 Plus the awful battery life: less than a 12-hour day with any real use
 So I have turned back the clock 10 years to a phone that does nothing other than CALL and TEXT
 OK, yes there is an FM Radio which actually is nice
 I took this on a business trip: after four days of light use, battery was still at 60% (3 of 5 bars)
 I didn't charge it when home until it had gone a whole week and was down to 2 bars of battery
 That is impressive
 Call quality is OK, not great
 The controls are pretty intuitive (the flashlight just takes an up press on the 4-way rocker
 I can dial a call in way less time than my touchscreen smartphone
 If I need GPS, etc, I take along my Nexus tablet, and can usually find hotspots along the way
 It does only simple SMS, can't even read MMS, so far I am OK with that
 The battery life alone makes this a great phone
 I got extra batteries so all I need to do is carry one of them instead of a big charger
 This phone takes the tiny Nokia barrel connector, it is NOT the common micro USB
 Phone book, calculator, other features work fine
 I've dropped it onto a cork or wood floor a couple of times: the back came off, battery came out, but no damage
 This is a great phone if you hate the complexity and frustration of a "smart" phone
 Not to mention the cost: $25 vs $200 to $600
 You can buy a really nice 7" or lrager tablet with the money you save

Nokia
 Very good cell phone
Battery lasts for 4 days
 and extremely strong falls almost every day nothing happens, very lightweight too

good
Their sims are not unlock but GSN


Inexpensive cell for those not interested in a entertainment device but to actually receive and make phone calls
 Simple, reliable and excellent quality
Very Good phone for basic need but the only minor issue is that the gripping is not so good

This little phone is great, it does everything that a phone should do, is not a smart phone, but it does the job and I really like it

excelente
Excellent cell phone
 Easy to use
 I recommend it
So simple and uncomplicated, that it will only announce ONCE that I have a text or voice mail
 I have missed many, many calls and texts
 Why not a simple reminder 'beep' every few minutes to tell me I have a text or voice mail

 I have ordered an LG 450 flip phone to replace it
 This is the dumbest phone I have ever had

I returned it because it didn't work with either SIM card I purchased for use in Germany

This cellphone is cheap in price and quality
 I have to walk all over the place to get a connection or for the receiver to hear me
 If dropped sometimes battery falls out

The battery lasts very long
 The signal is very weak inside of the building, I am not sure it is because of T-mobile or because of this phone

I love these Nokia bar phones
 They feel cheap and are cheap, but they are surprisingly durable, have great battery life, and just plain work
 I keep one around as a spare phone just in case one of our smartphones die unexpectedly
 Also really nice to keep in my suitcase when I travel internationally because I can pick up a local SIM and walk down the street without worrying about someone grabbing my expensive phone

Excelente
Great little low tech cell phone for my elderly mother
 She loves it

excelente
Great little phone
 Simple, lightweight
 More features than expected
 Long standby time of 30days +
I needed to return this phone, but for the fact that I bought it for someone outside the U
S
 it is not functioning it cannot attract any network to it
 I guess it is from the factory
My wife and I use a cellphone as a telephone, not a computer in our pocket
 This Nokia serves that need perfectly and very inexpensively
 We even keep a spare on hand with plenty of batteries, in case one of our phones gets lost or broken
 So far, the spare is still in the drawer
 It's absolutely amazing the performance of this little unit for the price

A nice little reliable phone
 Perfect to start your child on when him/her gets their 1st phone
 Well worth the money

excellent your product

This is my 2nd Nokia 106GSM cell phone
 I sent one back, because it took too long to connect to the provider which could be very dangerous if there is an emergency
 The one I kept also takes awhile to connect, after the phone is turned on, the times varies for a connection
 I am turning the phone on and off periodically to see how long, it will take for the phone to connect
 It seems to take at least one to five min
for connectionI read the reviews, but did not find any problems with the connection
 I would not purchase this item again, not reliable

Bought this to work on the T-Mobile network in the United States because the product description stated: "This unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T and T-Mobile
"Although the phone is unlocked, and the bands are similar between the two GSM/GPRS carriers, this Nokia 106 only recognizes the AT&T network
 Since the phone doesn't work with T-Mobile, the product description is mistaken at best, and at worst deliberately misleading
EDIT: Changed my rating from 1 star to 3 stars because this *does* work on T-Mobile, but only if you are in T-Mobile 2G coverage (900Mhz and 1800Mhz bands), which may not be the case even if you have LTE (smartphone) coverage
 If you only have AT&T coverage, this Nokia 106 will need to be turned on in an area with T-Mobile 2G coverage, after which the phone will thereafter recognize even weak T-Mobile 2G signals
 Only after performing the above step was the phone able to work on the T-Mobile network
Take note of the procedure above to avoid confusion and angst when trying to lock your phone onto the T-Mobile band

The antenna is rather poor
 The predictive text does not include simple emoticons
 It beeps when the person dialed picks up the line which is odd
Aside from these points (the first being significant enough for me to seek a refund) the phone is aesthetically pleasing, you can hear well and if the three above complaints weren't the case (especially the first) it's exactly what I wanted: a simple phone for texting, calling, telling time and waking me up only
 Oh there's also an excellent little flashlight
 Love that

No micro-USB :(
Perfect, Works great, Fast Service, love the product

It's okay, price is expensive

This is a basic phone
 And it does its job- Battery holds pretty well around 5 days- Small size basic calls
- Durable

exelente
great basic phone
Great value
 Arrived on time
"Emergancy calls only" I can't call or recive calls
 My sim works with other devices, whats wrong

excelen
excellent
The one I got was not working properly was defective
 Battery was only charging one block overnight
 Phone is not getting getting service ,the ringtone not working 
 Probably it is a defective phone
 I never expected a nokia phone to give so much problem

bueno
Bad
Very good
 but so big


excelente celular economic
Phone exactly as stated
 Shipping too a lot longer than I excepted but all is good
ok for price
EXCELENT
Terrible reception

excellent product they recommend any mishap
DON'T BUY THIS


 This is a rip off phone
 Once you try and change out the original sim card you start with, it goes into DEMO mode only
 It's been 9 months so I can't return it but they shouldn't even sell it or at least post a warning with it

nice, basic phone
 works like a charm

 forever

 and the battery almost never runs out

Maybe I am expecting too much from a 20 dollar phone; however, this product is so cheaply made, it could have been sold for less
Let's start off with the packaging
 Mine arrived in the mail, it was already halfway opened and the cardboard was crumbled
 On to the phone, it is very light and floppy, you can actually peel off the screen
 I did, the manufacturers used a cheap glue to glue the screen in
 But it gets worse
 The design is very bad
 WARNING

: It is almost impossible to get our sim card out of the device without bending or breaking either the sim card of phone
 But perhaps the worst part is that it did not even work
 I count send text messages or make phones calls
 IDK I have verison and nothing worked

still trying to figure out how to use it, but happy it is just on and off

perfect functionality GSM carrier free




It was not working in Asia


I thought it was unlocked for asia :(
The phone was useless in Africa
Satisfied
Terrible
I recommend it 100% good seller
It's has battery problem, It switch off with a command

:)
A great phone for people like me who just want a no-frills cellphone for calls and texts
 I'm not technologically illiterate by any stretch, but I didn't like how smartphones kept me plugged into everything 24/7
 This really is just an updated version of the venerable Nokia 1100, and feels like it could take a beating and still work great
 It even has a version of Snake
 I'm currently using it with Cricket Wireless but might switch to a cheaper carrier (like US Mobile) soon
 And it's cheap enough that I ordered another as a backup
Some reviews here said the phone wasn't unlocked, and I can't really see how that's possible
Great phone

EXCELENTE
thank
never buy,
Just as advertised

This is NOT Unlocked, doesn't work overseas
 Waste of money

Good
This may be a good phone, but can anyone explain why it is near impossible just to get the cover off to put the SIM in

five starts
It gets the job done

Simple phone, very light weight
 I bought it for my 84 yr young mother
 Satisfied
 She doesn't use any features, just phone calls and contact list

Great product

 Worth the money


Did the job just perfect for my dad he isn't even gonna try ta get into the smartphone world, he's like does it have numbers I can push to dial, get it
He doesn't even text, he just wants to call
he was so worried I wouldn't be able to find a phone the was a basic as his old one and wala here it is
thanks Amazon
The phone is not a representative of Nokia which I have carried before
 Very fragile and cheap looking
 Return it and exchange for another phone
Excelent
This phone is incompatible with MMS messaging, which your friends with smartphones may use from time to time
 It only uses the standard SMS technology, so I received many texts which the phone told me could not be displayed, and it took me a few weeks to figure out that I had missed some crucial messages
 Not the phone's fault, of course; I just didn't do my research well enough
If you are mainly going to be making phone calls, this phone is GREAT
 It's light and small, buttons feel good, battery life is long, and the phone is solid as a rock like Nokia always is
 I love Nokia, and this one feels like a warhorse, just like the Nokia 6030 that I bought eight years ago that this 106 replaced
 If texting is critical for you like it is for me, then this is not the phone for you
 I just ordered the Nokia 111 to replace this one- it can handle SMS and MMS messages

Within its limits its a very capable little device
 It's very inexpensive, the battery lasts incredibly long, the voice clarity is great, and it has excellent reception
 Back in 2003-2007 this device would have been a bestseller
 After breaking my smartphone I bought this as a backup,
It is a less-tan-30-dollar-non-contract-phone
 What can you say
 Perfect for Water White and Jessie Pinkman

Very light phone good for Sameone who is not into smart phones
GREAT tough little backup phone to have around when your fragile smartphone breaks
 Battery lasts for days
 No camera, bluetooth or pc connectivity, but you can make calls and text
 Also has an FM radio on it, but unfortunately you can't use just the radio without a sim card in it

So far it's a decent phone
 I've owned similar Nokia phones for several years now and they have always been very reliable
 For ~$26, I don't want to be overly critical but I do wish the call quality were better
 I read a lot of rave reviews prior to purchasing and almost all of the reviews mentioned great call quality but that has not been my experience
 My previous phone was a Nokia Xpress Music (old school
) and the call quality on that phone was always good so I don't think it's me
It came with a headphone set
 My ears tend to be on the larger size and I still found the ear buds to be too large
Pros:Inexpensive
Decent battery life (several days even after making multiple calls)You won't ever be caught ignoring your kids staring at a smart phone all day
Cons:Fair to mediocre call qualityNo Bluetooth capabilityEar buds are largeIf you have never owned a Nokia, be sure to read the instruction manual
 I was used to having buttons on the side of the phone to adjust the volume
 It took me a while to figure out the volume is adjusted only while in-call by using the left and right joystick button

Cheaply made
 No worth calling it a cell phone

We got two of these as backup phones during our family trip to the UK
 Excellent battery life
 Reception and voice is clear too
 We dropped them on numerous occasions accidentally, but this phone is ruf-n-tuf
 Well done Nokia

The simpler the better
 No problem at all with this phone

Great item
 It work really well for what I paid for

Simple yet excellent for those in need of just a basic phone to text and call

Veri good
Solid and simple
Nice and simple basic phone with good battery capacity
I saw two problems so far: even at maximum volume call is not heard when the phone is in a bag and not very good audibility when talking

Bought it for my non-US SIM card,GSM, it works

You guys cheated both phones are locked
 I spent 20 $ for unlocking
 I need it back
very good and cencillo listen very well to call me I can not fault the product 



Ty

excellent product recommended operating from Venezuela
The description of these phones was that they are unblocked and work on a GSM next work
 When they arrived in Zimbabwe they didn't work
 I don't know if this is common from this company or was this a mistake
 Anyway I'm disappointed and can't use these phones
My mom uses this phone and she is completely satisfied

That's what I needed: a simple phone which cannot connect to the Internet at all
 Excellent for using in an international trip when a data roaming costs much money

I bought this phone so that I could have a phone with no internet, as partial "unplug" thing
 It works great, although there are a few drawbacks
 It has a very small SMS memory, so the inbox fills up pretty quickly
 It doesn't have a way to auto-delete oldest first, so you have to either delete everything, including your newest messages, or individually delete each older message, which gets time consuming
 I text a lot, so that's a big annoyance for me
I also wish that you could send it a picture via MMS (since there's no data port and no internet, that leaves only MMS) to set as a background picture
 Alas, it doesn't handle MMS at all
 That also makes receiving group messages nearly impossible, as most smartphones send group messages as MMS instead of SMS
Call quality is pretty good though, and it came with a handsfree wired (it doesn't have bluetooth) headset
The SIM tray is easy to use; because it is a tray, not a slot, I was able to insert the micro-SIM from my smartphone without any trouble
Battery life is excellent
 I took this on a business trip for two weeks, using it to text and talk for a couple hours each day, and only had to charge it a few times

Loved the phone
The Nokia 106 works well enough
 I used a AT&T prepaid sim card for service
 I only have to charge it once a week with low usage
 My only issue is that it does not receive group text message, but I knew that from reading the other reviews
 Would recommend if all you need is a phone to call and text on

quick shipmentgood value
Exclent


Excellent

It is not unlocked
It didn't worked as expected neither
 We take it to a technical services and they told us that it didn't work with our sim card because probably the cell phone recive a strong stroke or it was expose to humidity
not opened to my network so I am unable to use it
Nice
Genial
This phone is advertised as being unlocked but it is not


 Avoid

Good small basic phone
 Good sound, plenty loud voice and ringer
 Great battery life
 Screen could be brighter

excelente producto, 100% recomendado
Worked well
 Quick delivery

excellente
love it



I bought this for my dad who only knows how to call
 It's a pretty basic phone
 And it worked for T-Mobile, so I don't know why other people are saying it's locked

excellent
All very good, responsible and punctual, I recommend 100%
I took the phone to Brazil and it would only work with one sim card
 The sim card that had worked in other phones
 Could not get any signal, zero bars
 I was not happy

Excellent
goob
I purchased this for my 12 year old son
 He really enjoys the radio feature
 It was very quick and easy trip to the cell phone store to setup

Item was as described
 Thanks
DOesn't work with T-mobile

Nice cellphone

Very satisfied
Since stole me my excellent Nokia, I decided on this model that can talk, answer, read, and write
 The cell works fine
 I agree

no chinese characters in this phone

Comes preloaded with Facebook and Twitter
 No way to remove
 Also, constructed in a very flimsy way, especially for Nokia
Looks cool and fits comfortably in the pocket

Nothing is wrong with the phone why I rated it so low, but I took it internationally and it only worked on one network, the one my dad doesn't use
 So I was disappointed in that
 I know it's not your fault though

The only bad for this cel phone is that is no have wi-fi, but everything else is very good, is easy to use phone
This phone is for my dad and I wanted to buy something small and standard
 He's not into smart phones so I thought this'd be a good purchase

The mobile is said international, but it have no Chinese language
 I am very disappointed
 So I think it should tell buyer what language it have in product Details

buen equipo, en exelente estado, solo actualice el softwere a español y listo, opera muy bien hasta ahora, excelente lo recomiendo
The phone comes with an angry birds game for free, this was a very cool surprise :) XD 1 2
The product was delivered on time and it's not different from the picture
It's a good value for the price paid
 There were no scratches or dents noticed upon delivery
 I will recommend it to my friends
Item was for my dad
 Seems to work fine till now so no complaints
The touchscreen is also not to bad

CARAMBA NOKIA TENIA QUE SER


QUE TECNOLOGUIA TAN MARAVILLOSA, HASTA AHORA NO HABIA TENIDO UNO CON TANTOS ADELANTOS COMO LO TIENE ESTE MODELO DE TELEFONO
It is very good, but it don't have wifi
 Its design is friendly, ergonomic and intuitive
 Alone have languajes english and chinese

Bought this to use on my international trip, this is a nice phone does all the basic function better than all the high end super computers we carry in our hands
 so who love the basics and want just that, this is definitely a good pick
 good job nokia


 but dont know how long you will be in business




it does everything i want it to do and more and it didn't cost any where near what an iphone 6 would cost

This is one of the waste of money

Its no NEW


 Its a used one


 What a fake



It is made with very cheap material
 The display was not so clean
 I had to return it

i don't like it
not happy with it
Definitely NOKIA are another thing, this model meets my basic needs (text messaging, internet and other functions that I have not put into practice)
 I'm not passionate to highly sophisticated handsets, such as Ipods, galaxy and similar person
 The 'only criticism that I make is not very good sound quality, it sounds dull, as if the caller had a cloth covering his mouth
 Curiously, it is the only technology that does not move me the floor
 Sorry you did not include in its menu the Spanish language, but I still works well
Definitivamente los NOKIA son otra cosa, este modelo cumple mis necesidades elementales (mensajeria de texto, internet y demás funciones que no he puesto en practica) 
 No soy persona apasionada a teléfonos de alta sofisticación, como los Ipods, galaxy y similares
 La 'unica critica que le hago es la no muy buena calidad de sonido, suena opaco, como si la persona que te llama tuviera un paño tapándole la boca
 Curiosamente es la única tecnología que no me mueve el suelo
 Lamento que no haya incluido en su menu de idiomas el Español, pero igual me funciona bien

I can not find anything I do not like about this phone
 Size is comfortable
 Call quality is great and the interface is easy to figure out
This phone had some really great features I liked
 Easy to use,you could record a call you were on and a few other neat things preinstalled
 Looks nice, feels good

Great Basic EASY to function/use phone
It has a few fun options but nothing crazy
 I got this for my mom who has no clue how to use simple functions of a phone but this phone was pretty easy to set up for her and she liked using it

I sent this phone to my parents who are living in India
 The phone is locked to US region
 Zero stars


This phone is totally recommended , basic functions good signal excellent touchscreen applications and light
In general I recommend to buy this product
(For Spanish users it has one disadvantage , it does not have Spanish text for SMS and menu either)
This phone is great, light weight, easy to use, the camera is decent and it is very compact and fits in my pocket
 Texting is easy, the display is great and easy to see
 The signal is much better than other phones
Once I charge it after 4 days of use and it still has battery life on it
 This is all I'm looking for, an easy to use and great looking phone
1
 Excellent signal2
 Email account support3
 Social Networks4
 Great battery life5
 Great camera6
 Light weight7
 Nice screen that you can touch and no need for navigation key
So far this phone is everything I expected; its easy to use, has a decent processor, stable software, good camera and lots of apps to download
But it has some limitations I was simply not expecting to see in a new Nokia phone:- The camera despite having a decent quality is has none of the basic options other simpler phones provide, it lacks filters, color modes, and even brigthness adjusment
- The battery life can be kind of short, I don't make many calls but I do browse the web a lot and this can consume the battery in just 2 days specially if you are using 3G
- The internet browser doesn't display most pages in the most ordely way one would expect and you have very little control over the zoom so you either see the pages from too far or you see them way to close, so much that the text sometimes gets compressed in a very thin column- It doesn't display menu options in spanish, despite being international and having, italian, french and portuguese language packages installed
Another problem I had was that the signal reception is kind of weak, but this One is mostly caused by my current carrier (MOVILNET) here in Venezuela
 Aparently some carriers here are not very friendly with unlocked phones some apps that require internet accses like "Whatsapp" are not supported or barely suported, I had to change the data packet acces point manually to use internet and still I have a lot of limitations and I will probaly have to move to a more stable but expensive carrier like Digitel or Movistar
ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU CAN CONFIGURE ANY UNLOCKED PHONE YOU ARE GONNA BUY TO USE IT AT ITS FULLEST IN YOUR COUNTRY, READ LOTS OF REVIEWS, AND CONSULT FORUMS, YOU CAN'T JUST PUT A NEW SIM CARD EXPECT EVERYTHING TO WORK FINE SOMETIMES IS NOT THAT SIMPLE

As you can expect from a Nokia phone, great performance
 The only problem I had with it


 no Spanish menus


 that's not a problem for me, but it is for the person I bought the phone for
Maybe is because it's an International Version, besides that, great phone

Good
good
EXCELENTE
We are no rookies to Nokia phones
 We purchased this for international travel
 It worked "ok" for our purposes (calling, texting) but had serious issues randomly turning off, deleting messages, and poor call quality
 I would definitely recommend spending the money rather on the newer Nokia Windows phones instead (which is what we did after this purchase)
 I wish I could get my money back for this phone

does not deserve 5 points
This phone came imprinted with Movistar on the back, which suggests that it is locked to that provider
 But that's not a huge deal for me, since the whole point for me was to test web pages over WiFI
Unfortunately, WiFi doesn't actually work
 I can't connect to my home network at all
 Internet searches suggest the problem could be solved by adding an active SIM card
 That's unlike pretty much every other WiFi-enabled phone on the market

it's a good phone if your not a phone person and is just looking for something simple but still have features like the other phone then go for this
Phone does not work wellThis phone first of all would not be charged with the charger included in the box, now the touchscreen responds at will, it is worst than my broken 5810

I have seen many sites that try to compare this feature phone to smartphones and that would be a mistake
 This is NOT a smartphone (despite what Nokia tries to put on their website)
 That being said, it is probably the best non-smartphone that you can find that will not cost you an automatic data plan charge on your bill
 You see, I have AT&T as my cell phone provider and they will automatically charge you a data plan once their computers recognize that your SIM card is in a smartphone
 I made that mistake when I bought a smartphone without knowing their policy and I was automatically put on a data plan for that month
 At that point, I put my SIM back into my old Samsung and sent the smartphone back
Then I started doing heavy research to find a phone that would provide me with many of the same features as a smartphone but would not be recognized by AT&T as a smartphone
 Eventually I came across the Asha series of phones
 I was about to buy the Asha 302 at first, then the 501 but after looking on phonearena, I came to the conclusion that this phone was probably the most advanced in the series
 I bought it and I'm very happy that I did
 I haven't seen a data plan charge since I've started using this phone
 In order to be sure though, I decided to turn off mobile data
 So I only use wifi on the phone (and I advise you to do the same just to be safe)
 Still, this phone has basically served as an extra computer for me in the house
Just don't expect the world from it
 The map app is just OK (it's no Google Maps), the app selection is pretty lame (the Nokia store doesn't offer much), and the games that are actually worth playing and the phone can handle (it only plays Java games) are few and far between
 Angry Birds and Plants vs
 Zombies are two that come to mind
 Don't even bother trying to play Temple Run on this phone; there's no java version out there worth talking about
Overall though, this is the most advanced dumbphone I have ever seen
 Compare this phone to other feature phones, not smartphones and I think you will be very happy with your purchase

She loves it
 Thinks the size is ideal for an 11 year old, loves the way it navigates
 Talks about the picture quality non-stop and that she can brighten pictures taken at night - wooohooo

I got this phone for my wife and so far she really likes it, it is easy to use, stylish, has many features, very good reception (our provider is att) & the battery life is very good as well
 It is not a smartphone but it has a very good browser with excellent wifi access, internet radio etc and it does an excellent job in features that I usually use in my Sony Xperia ion smartphone with a price much less than a classic smartphone

Too flimsy to use but the technology is good
 They could have made this phone little bigger and not sure why they made it so small

I've had this phone a week now
 I replaced a Nokia 6102i and I wanted a phone that did not need a data plan with my provider
 One drawback is that the text message interface is presented as conversations, so it's a little different when it comes to finding sent messages or saving messages
 You can't delete the facebook, store, online games, and other "data" icons, although there is a provision to customize one of the three screens that opens when you swipe the lock screen
 The ringtone is loud enough for me to hear from another room in the house but I'm not sure it would be for someone with much hearing loss, and it takes a couple of swipes to get to the menu where the ringtone volume can be turned up
 Also, I had to work a couple of hours to find the MMS settings online since this is an unlocked phone that is not supported by my well-known cell service provider
 That was the most difficult obstacle
 On the plus side, the on-screen qwerty keyboard is good and the capacitive touch screen is exactly like that on an iPod touch once you turn off the vibration-on-touch feature
 It's pretty much impossible to dial this phone inadvertently since the screen locks and can't be unlocked without a deliberate swipe
 The camera is so much better than the one I had on my flip phone that I really can't complain
 It came with a 2 GB mini SD and uses a Nokia proprietary charger with the tiny pin
 It is not heavy at all and doesn't protrude from my pocket like I thought it might
 It has Nokia's proprietary ringtones and provisions for adding additional ones
 The music player is intuitive and the radio works with the headphones that come with the phone
 It looks like the standby battery life is two or three days, a little shorter than what I had on my Nokia flip phone but perfectly acceptable

I bought this because AT&T is raising smartphone prices to unfair levels
 This is the closest thing to a smartphone without actually being a smartphone
 It cost a third of what my smartphone was costing me and has most of the features
 I get unlimited data on this which is very useful
 The item is not as described though, it comes with a 2GB SD card, not 4GB
 I was planning on putting a much bigger 32GB card in but that is not the point, the description lied
 It works on AT&T's network pretty fluidly
 All calls and messages are received
 It arrived without an ability to connect to AT&T's data network, it took me hours to figure it out until I stumbled upon a video [


] which helped me so much, now the data works
 It needs a factory reset because out of the box the apps were not launching right
 The free 40 EA games don't seem to work yet for some reason, no big deal though
 The screen itself is extremely tiny, they could have added another half inch in there at least
 The operating system makes up for that though, it is very user friendly
 Except for the fact you can not control the brightness level
 If you're willing to put in a half-hour tops of work into this once you get it, it really does pay off
PROS:-Super Cheap On Data-User friendly-Apps (not many but still)-Capacitive Touchscreen-3
5 mm headphone port-Upgradeable Memory (Up To 32GB)-Stylish-FM Radio-Decent Camera (3
2 MP)-Wi-Fi-Pin Code Lock-Internet Radio-Data ManagementCONS:-Pain To Set Up-No front camera-Not many apps-Only A 2GB SD Card-No Brightness Control-Small Screen-Non-Removable BloatwareI would reccomend this to someone who is willing to sacrifice some smartphone luxuries without sacrificing them all to save a lot of cash

Not all the features found on modern smart phones but it does the job and well
 Recommend for anyone needing a smartphone like device at a budget price, since it still has web browser, whatsapp, internet radio, angry birds, etc

I bought this for travel
 It was unlocked and works great
 The screen scratched a little easily though

Thumb up 👍
good
Fine phone
 I've had it for two years now
 I hate touch phones and am trying to avoid them as much as possible, so I was really excited when I found this half touch half candybar phone
 Everything is good, I have no complaints
 Though I think it was used when I first bought it, but what can I do about that now
 The only bad thing is that the volume sucks
 I can barely hear people when I talk on the phone, but it's not that big of a problem because I have a headset I use or just put it on loudspeaker/make sure I only make phone calls in quiet places

very satisfied excellent device but the key pad and resistive touch screen takes getting used to
good
muy bueno
this cellphone is kind of difficult to handle because of the touch and type, but it's OK
bueno
it died after 13 months

Excellent product



I received a phone used
Refurbished but came like new, excellent phone for the price

Fine
There was a missing battery cover and missing memory card I return it back
It has a large range of applications, according to my service provider

excellent recommend them
Looks good and very lighter 
 Touch screen is not that great 
 OK for its price and good for elder people who only use the phone for calling 

muy bien
working perfectly ok 



nice phone for the price

Exelente
Good


EXCELLENT
works greats

Excellent

Yes it met my expectations
 It is a neat phone, but one thing though you should be able to put the what's app icon on your display screen
 But it is a great phone I have no regrets

lost
Not compatible in usa for data
is a nice phone
very happy with this product
Terrible company, personal not helpful at all
 Would not recommend it to anyone

Excellent 











Does not work and will return it
BUENO
very good
It is excelent
yeeah
Just received the phone i ordered at first look i really like it
 It's very slim and perfect for my mom's tiny hands
 However i was disappointed because they sent a damaged phone
 Only keypad 4578 are working, the rest don't
 Good thing it was fullfilled by amazon I was able to call the customer service right away and they helped in the returns

I am very pleased with the phone
 It is very light, easy to use, and delivers great call quality
 Nokia is still my favorite brand

This phone is WONDERFUL
 I have missed Nokia
 At&t (especially where I live in central WI, USA) has not carried Nokia for a long while
 This particular phone is European, even comes with a European wall charger - this fact would have been useful to know
 You can however buy an adapter or use the small USB port to charge it
 You have to do some "hacking" to turn on your picture messaging and internet data - At&t will more-than-likely not help you with this
 It took some google searching and lots of setting changes to get all the functions to properly work for this "unlocked" phone
 You will also notice European settings, word spellings are different, calendar format is different than the US, but most of these features are of course changeable
 Has great sound quality and radio feature
 Battery life is about 3 days with my occasional usage
 It lasts almost an entire day in the "battery low" feature - so I would say it has great battery life
 The internet searching can get messing sliding all around, but I was just glad when I could turn the internet feature on
All in all, this is a sturdy little phone
 love the sleek slim design and small nature of the phone
 Buttons require a firmer push to operate - but this may cut down on the butt dialing :) I am in love
 Thanks Nokia

I bought this phone for my son, who is throughly enjoying it
Works like a charm the first time I placed in my sim card
He loves the music most of all

Many people have commented on the good quality of the sound of this phone
 (which was the main reason I purchased it)Its size and keypad design are good for normal use
 ( I have large hands and find it not difficult) I find myself searching for the 0 though, but I still like the design
The overall feel and design of the phone are very impressive
 It doesnt look cheap
The camera is better than I expected (I wasnt expecting much)
The touch screen is ok
 It is a little tough to get used to
 Initially I turned off the haptic feedback vibration in hopes to preserve battery, but I found that it helps with navigating the touch screen
 Though the proximity sensor doesn't always work when making a call, so my ear will set off the screen and get a vibration sometimes
Battery life is pretty good (I charge maybe once a week with moderate use)
I use this phone as pay-per-use, and for that I would say it is excellent
If you are expecting this to be a smartphone, you will be thoroughly disappointed
However, if you want a relatively cheap high quality unlocked phone to use as a 'phone', I would highly recommend this

El teléfono a penas lo abro lo enciendo y después de 5 minutos se apago y no encendió mas no lo recomiendo
I didn't know how to stuff a stocking so I saw this phone for a 10 year old hope he likes it

Telephone bad, the screen stopped working a week of use
 Not recommend very bad phone
 Really I'm very disappointed with the phone, it was for a birthday present and I felt very sorry priate said they hurt me 



I do not recommend purchasing this item at this store because at the time I made this purchase they sent me another phone that did not have to do with what I wanted was not even the same cell caracterísicas was a very very basic, beware
My first Nokia broke when it vibrated off my kitchen counter but I had to replace it because I LOVE this phone
 It survived several falls before that with ease, has a great camera and has both great touchscreen technology and buttons to push
 The nice perk is that I can operate the touchscreen with my gloves on
 I also like that I'm not locked into a data plan like with smartphones

I bought this Nokia cell phone because I used phones with a number pad before and didn't like using a touchscreen phone
 And because I used Nokia before and this one was the only good looking cell phone that has a key pad (and WiFi, but thats not too important) I finally bought this one
I had a Nokia 6303i classic before and I would still prefer my old cell phone, but it had problem with the battery after a while and turned itself off for no reason
What you have to know about the X3-02:- Its pretty slim and small- They keys are good to write messages, what was the main thing why I need those keys- It has an interchangable memory card- You can use WiFi and download opera mini browser in the app store if you want- You can modify your start screen with a few things like showing your contact favorits, your calendar, notes, time, shortcuts to programs, but nothing special- I would say the call quality is pretty good, at least for me
 Don't know how people hear me- It's nice that you have a little button on the side of your phone to lock your screen
 If you want that nobody has access to your phone then, you need to apply your PIN code to the screen locker
 There is no app that allows you just to draw a special pattern to unlock your phone
- I don't see that the battery lasts for too long
 I hardly use it and it maybe lasts for a few days
 But it's nice that the USB port and the port for charging battery and for speakers are all on the top of the cell phone and not on the bottom or the side- The Nokia ovi app store is propably the worst thing on this phone
 Don't think just because it has a touchscreen that you can play games you could play on your Android
 There is hardly any app for free in this app store
 Sometimes it is also just a demo when you find something for free
 And if it really is for free then you need Internet access everytime you want to play that game, because it shows a short ad everytime it starts- Also the rest of the phone's menu and style looks pretty much the same as it is with all Nokia phones
 Pretty old style and hardly anything to modify (you can use your own ring and message tone), but therefore you have a phone that will be fast no matter what and can use WiFi
you can buy the Nokia X3-02 TOUCH AND TYPE WHITE Unlocked Phone this very nice, the price and the cost
The chargers are European with a US electrical adapter
 Unfortunately the one included with my phone did not work so I called for a replacement
 They responded however the replacement adapters consisting of two components fit so loosely that you have to put them in some sort of a self designed fixture to assure a good connection between the pieces and a successful charge
I asked for just a US charger but received the European adapters
 Maybe Nokia does not offer this phone in the US and therefore no US charger


Good outlook with slim design
 Touch screen functions OK
 Low voice volume with incoming calls,which may caused by the earphones

Phone arrived as suggested; the screen resolution is not that good
 The touch screen responsiveness is also not that good
 if you want a basic phone to make and receive calls, this is good for that
 Screen is small enough so you cannot browse the internet
 price should be below $100
if I feel disappointed because you buy this product with great pleasure and I waited with eager, but then it came and I went to use my surprise is that the phone does not have a Spanish option, and therefore must change the solfware 
 so I suggest you send phone with Spanish, not to spend additional money
Nokia X3-02 TOUCH AND TYPE WHITE Unlocked Phone
NOT COMPATIBLE WITH ALL USA LTE BANDS 


Beware


 This device will not give you an LTE connection on AT&T in the USA
The add that linked my to this purchase indicated it would work on US bands, don't be fooled
You'll need to get an unlocked AT&T brands version to get it to work on LTE in the USA, and then have to deal with the bloatware
Phone is Great, the camera is AWESOME, and unlocked with little or no bloatware is incredible
 if I could only get one like this with the US bands
 it would be perfect and a 4 - 5 stars
GOOD

I got software problem with in 2 months of buying it, and they they did not offered me any warranty
 Dont buy this device through third party without insurance

Great cellphone with an excelent camera

Very fast and works with all carrier gsm in Venezuela
 I am very satisfied with the speed of this smartphone
It will be hard to go back to regular digital cameras after using the camera on this phone
 Quality of pictures in tricky situations is simply amazing

Didn't work out of the box
 No bars
 Got a Nokia 2320 and it picked up the network right away
 Tried cycling the power, standing outside, driving around, etc
I did like how the buttons felt and the screen was fine, too
 The radio had good reception, too
 I had used a SanDisk MP3 player a while back that had a terrible radio and was braced for the worst
 But the radio worked fine indoors and out

The phone I recieved while a Nokia 1280 is not the phone depicted
 Phone described is black, phone I recieved is "orchid" read, "pink"
 Also the charger is not compatible with North America
 Luckily I have a spare charger and my wife has the same phone but black so I will be trading with her
 Nontheless a practical phone that does what its supposed to do, make and recieve calls with good standby and talk time
 We am going to keep this phone because we need it, however I would have looked elsewhere had the description been more accurate

OK
 Biggest benefits of these phones are dual sim and long battery life
 Software is a bit dated now

I got it in good time and I am very please with this purchase

Korean not supported
The phone did not work in my country , but the signs said they worked for all Latin America
I'm a little upset about the purchase
 I lost my money
They could answer

Very simple and easy to use
Called 'unlocked' but it ws not unlocked
 Tried AT&T and they said the phone is locked

good
Just got mine in the mail today and I love it
 Get a mini sd card for your storage needs and you're in business (the phone itself has very little storage)
 The trickiest part is setting up MMS so you can send/receive pictures, but it can be done
 I found probably the best tutorial on how to get this set up here : http://www
povertymobile
com/att_gophone_mms_settings_on_nokia_220/
Excellent Luddite phone, perhaps the best currently available in US
 I had an old candybar phone that died about a year ago
 It was awesome, the battery would last 5-7 days
 I've been searching for a comparable phone ever since, and have investigated dozens of feature phones
 With most, despite assurances to the contrary, the battery wouldn't last much more than a day
 But the battery on this one lasts for days 


Pros:--battery life--solid voice quality--quick and smooth operating system--good predictive texting--threaded text messages--simple mp3 player--flashlight--web browser so slow you'll never be tempted to use it--little 2mp camera good enough for quick, unimportant picsCons:--has web browser--buttons a bit small (though I have huge hands and don't really have a difficult time navigating the buttons)--can't delete apps from menu--AT&T about to take down 2g network, leaving only TMobile's
This phone is not very good
 Keep in mind it's the OLD SCHOOL texting kind of set up where you have to scroll through the letters so if you text a little or a lot keep that in mind
 Yes it's a basic phone but the sound is horrible when talking on it and I get no bars all the time
 Even if you are looking for something basic I say spend a little more and go with a better phone
The phone is not working with the SIM card
 Unfortunately, I'm too far away to return now
 DO NOT BUY THIS PROSUCT

I am giving this cell phone 5 stars and it's proof Nokia should have continued making cell phones
I bought this as a gift for my mother, she wanted a basic phone to make and receive calls
 She doesn't like touchscreens
After looking for something for her, I came upon this cell phone and it has been a great purchase
Good:° Good build quality (It's Nokia afterall)
° Good call reception
 My mother says she hears clearly when talking on the phone
 No issues with signal
° Keypad is comfortable and responsive
Not So Good:° The screen could have been designed with a better resolution
Some people have stated they received a knock-off
 It's important to remember to buy only from sellers with solid reputation
 I did and I received the phone on time and with no issues
5 stars because at this price ($35) there's no way you're going to get something better
 The best phone for people who just want a basic phone to make and receive calls
 Recommended

The Nokia 220 is a great little, basic phone
 Light weight and cool design
 Not a lot to it, but for a phone that is so inexpensive, it doesn't what it's supposed to
 Clear phone call quality and easy to use Nokia OS
 Makes me miss the good old days of "dumb phones"

Overall a good phone for the price
 There is no way to get rid of unwanted menu icons and the phone call quality is not what I expect from Nokia but the phone is durable

I like it this phone a lot
This phone is not unlocked
 I can't make calls
Great GSM phone
 Lite, well built, plenty of extras

The phone is working for now but it is so cheaply made I wonder how long it will last

Excellent product

excellent phone, works fine in Venezuela

This is a very good basic cellphone, and works perfectly in Venezuela

I have never been able to get this phone to work
 I have tried multiple sims and no success
 I am not 100% certain this is a actual nokia phone

I bought this phone for my mom as it said unlocked, but international sim is not working it says it locked phone, very disappointed

Very good phone, just the Bluetooth only works for transfering stuff, doesn't work with my car and for music, so I give 4 stars

good price, good product

it is nice and beautiful all do I haven't start using it
An awesome unlocked cell phone
 I couldn't receive/send any images through at&t gophone service
 I took it into a retailer and they were able to fix it so I could send photos, the only problem is that it can't download large photo images from smartphones (and that's what everyone sends photos with these days)BATTERY IS AMAZING
 I can go a week or more without charging
I got a 32 GB memory card and I can play so much music from this phone, it's great
It calls/texts/plays music and that's all I need a phone to do
This phone is super great
 Definitely recommend

You can watch the unboxing here http://youtu
be/ibP8Uv7JzKcFor features just click on this link http://youtu
be/hi-vTPLKQEcOverall I wasn't too happy with this phone
 It definitely didn't meet my needs
 The phone is unresponsive and the screen is too small
 The keypad slows me down when I send messages
 This phone is perfect for somebody who will only use this phone for calling and nothing else
 It's definitely not a smart phone

Good
Excelent :D
(after 2 weeks using it)*Pros:- light- I charge battery once a week
 Just one hour to get full
- can listen to mp3 music, radio
*Cons:- Voice sound (inside) is not big- the headphone come with the phone is not good
 I don't feel comfortable wearing it
*Other: I don't use data plan so I have no idea about facebook, twitter, yahoo, news apps

doesn't support arabic

Phone was bought for my granny, she loved it

I bought this item last year and took it to Africa where I discovered was not unlocked phone because it could not work
 I asked them to send it back to USA and I have it now
 How are going to help me for the manufacturer to fix this problem

My phone was damage 1 week before I received
 Really bad choice

Nice
Simple phone that does the trick if you just need to talk and text
 Can't beat the price

could not get it to receive pictures or send them either-i took it to an ATT center to no avail- i had to buy another phone
I wanted a cheap a nonsmart phone, and this phone works
 It is very basic, which is why it's cheap, but it is missing some stuff I would have assumed even a basic phone would have
 First, the bluetooth doesn't work with headsets or your car, it is only for transferring files with Nokia's "Slam" thing
 It also doesn't have any sort of memo/note pad/reminder thing (you can take audio memos, but who wants to do that
), you can just text yourself reminders
 There is 0 customization, can't delete, or move icons
 The audio player doesn't have any concept of albums, or even folders, every song is in one giant list
 This isn't too bad for me since I just keep it on random, which works well
 The internal memory is super small, although I haven't used it enough to hit that
 Even with a 32 GB SD card, you have to keep your messages on the phone, and they will fill it up quickly
The call quality is good enough, and the battery lasts about a week with light use (a few short calls and texts, and maybe 30 mins of music listening a day)
 I am using Ting in the US, they use T-Mobile's network
 So it works fine with them
Some other random notes: The charger that comes with it has the wire attached to the plug, it's not just a AC to USB adapter and then a USB cable
 The paper manual was in spanish, but the english version is online
 The FCC ID is: QTLRM-971, if you want to check that out
 It is, in fact, GSM 850/1900, even though all the stats I could find about this phone online said it was GSM 900/1800
 It doesn't vibrate when plugged in, keep that in mind if you try to test it when you first get it
 The case is totally smooth, I could see dropping it very easily, although I would expect it to survive
I will probably get a Nokia 301 from eBay, which is about twice as much, but fixes the problems I listed above
 I'm still giving 4 stars to this phone, since it was so cheap, and does work fine as a phone
One last note, there are some comments saying they get a Chinese knock off
 You have to check the rating of your seller, Amazon combines sellers for the same product on this page, so you never know who you are buying from unless you go up to the top of the page and check them out (and keep in mind it'll change often as the cheapest seller changes)
 For what is worth mine was legit
 Other customers have posted pictures of both the legit and fake boxes

I can't schang language

Having used an iPhone for a few years, I was surprised when I ran out of memory for text messages on this phone
 Also, the only wired headset that works with it is the one that comes with it - a not-too-comfortable Nokia piece
Long battery life and clear voice calls make it a nice phone
 Just have to remember to delete messages every few days

Great phone
 Very basic but excellent choice for a grandpa or grandma

 was i expected

phone ringer and vibration wasn't working
 in addition the phone speaker was very weak that you can barely hear the voice
I returned the phone

Bought 2 phones to use in Asia and did not work
 Worst phone ever
 Throw in the trash
 Didn't bother to return

this is crazy, i have been waiting for this phone , it's been a month and a week i ordered this phone
Total disappointment
 I sold an imitation product that indicated in the original sale
 He says he is white and is not, what you sell is a product of black color and is not original 


 I lost 40 dollars in this deception
 I am very upset
 Would not recommend
excellent
excellte god
básico, pero muy bueno
Great
Perfect

nice, compact and durable
it's a low end phone with minimal options
 only two languages
 really

Not working in India
Bluetooth does not work for any other use than transferring the phonebook i guess
 It will pair with my cars and show the phonebook but not pass audio or calls through it or even when using a regular bluetooth headset
 Built in "apps" dont pass data at all, therefor useless but thats ok, i wanted to get rid of my Galaxy S5 and be less internet addicted
VERY light weigh, i'm always checking my pocket to see if i lost it
Feels like a toy
 Feels built solid though too, very strange when you hold it

Am so disappointed this phone is not unlock






Bought this phone as unlock but unfortunately is not very disappointed 




why state is unlock whiles is not 



not recommending no body to get this phone
Excellent 



Excellent
like my little phone

This phone is not unlocked as it says
 I first tried it in the USA and did not work
 Then l took it to overseas and still not working with any network
I have even been gone beyond to contact Nokia on it, the company said it does not have the software for this version to unlocked it
The most painful part of this deal is that, the phone is oversea and l can not return it for my money, because l bought it for my MOM in Africa
Never again should any unlocked phones be bought from this vendor
 I have regretted my purchase, l first knew Nokia phones were good brand to be trusted
Thank you

Good phone :)
this product is Chinese, of poor quality, do not buy it
Don''t recall ordering or receiving it

This is a basic cellphone, it actually seems to be genuine Nokia
 IT IS NOT FROM CHINA, at least mine isn't
 It sais "Made in Vietnam"
 A little bit curious 'couse I always thought Nokia was from Thailand, but I love it
 Does the basic things of a cellphone, not too much laggy when you writte text messages, I haven't wrote larger text messages, but so far so good
 Works perfect in Venezuela
 Earphones sounds as classic as Nokia always have been, sounds kinda loudy, wich is good when you are on your way to the University or to Work and you don't want to listen anything than your music
Anyways, the only thing I'm praying is I wish this phone has a long life lasting typical of Nokia


I'm gonna add a few photos of the cellphone, I hope it can help you to make a better choice
 I'm kinda picky when I'm buying things on the internet, and that's why I want to help people like me
 Good Luck

Very disappointed with this phone for two main reasons; 1 in the specs it has blue tooth however that is not true, the Bluetooth only will transfer data not connect with a head set
2 the profiles for the ringtones don't save your preferences, so every time I put the phone in silent it still rings
Phone is network locked, hate to say "i trusted those people"
Excellent product recommend to the community
 Cheers
Don't working
 Network so is garbej
 Money is garbej because is not working

Bought this for my wife, who tends to ignore her phones until she needs them 


 whereupon they're flat as a pancake
 This very basic phone has a superb battery life, an OK camera, and served her needs perfectly

nice basic phone for my dad
 have had no complaints from him
very good








Darn hard to open the back cover; in fact, I couldn't open it without taking atool to it which would most likely ruin the product
 I had to return it for the Nokia X3-02 model, which I already have and the new one would be used for another carrier SIM card
 I am providing a review of my limited but informative experience
The 220 is bigger than it looks (I was hoping it would be the size of the Motorola Rockr (a well built phone--couldn't find batteries for it anymore))
 It is light and the complete back casing where the phone's face snaps into the rear housing-case is good at eliminating dirt and what-not that tends to get into the back of phones
 It feels like a $50 phone; buttons feels a little cheap--not cheap but a little cheap--like $50 cheap
 There is no open anywhere else other than for the charger and headphone jacks
 Here's the problem this phone posed for me that make it not workable for my purposes: I do not like to "transfer" my files on the SD micro card; I like to pop it out of the phone, insert it into a thumb USB drive and plug it into my computer to open (I avoid all the registering, logging in here and there, updates that and this, tracking me here and there, and all the other pain in the butt trailer tagging electronic vendors tie to your every move/use
 So access to the SD card is often and since I couldn't even open the back cover off to put the phone's battery it, (if you have joint problems or joint issues this phone is not for you) well, it wouldn't work for me
 It looks like a snap on video, but it's a serious impediment in real life, and I'm no weakling--I'm sure I could open it with the beyond normally required force, but I could have snap or break something inside rendering it less desirable
 If I have to exert more than normally required, it would not work for me who routinely removes the SD card
 For me, regardless of how well it functions, for my purposes, the hard to open back cover was the deal breaker
I already have a Nokia X3-02 and that's a great phone; really thin, super sleek; I don't care what phone you have, when I pull the X3-02 out, I get double looks
 I just didn't want to have two of the same, but it looks like that's my only option in the unlock GMS candy-bar style

Was shipped and delivered as promised
 The item served the purpose and it's easy to maneuver

Good cell phone

This phone complete garbage worst one i ever bought, it didn't pick up signal at all, i had to return it back to amazon

Trying to find a replacement for my fantastic old Nokia 5310, I thought this would be as close as I could get — small, Nokia, candybar design
 Sadly, it was a significant step down
- Tinny sound (both incoming and outgoing)- No volume toggle (but then, that seems common in these cheaper models)- Feels flimsy- Low-res screenAnd most importantly: NOT compatible with bluetooth earpieces
 Oh, it has bluetooth, but only for syncing
 Go figure
Still three stars, as long as you know what you're getting into
 If you're just looking for a CHEAP phone that won't fall apart, it's better than BLU and some other low-end brands

didn't work in india
excellent product, good design, comfortable to wear, I recommend
Highly recommended

Not too happy because the black color phone, but I ordered white color

Excellent cellphone




It never worked
 This did not work since I got out of its box, unfortunately I knew that on coming to Venezuela
 I don't return it because transportation is very expensive
if I could return at no cost I would do that, and buy my beloved Nokia C3-01
Very nice for a simple phone
 I purchased this for my brother who just wanted a simple phone but one that has an mp3 player and this one filled the bill
 He hasn't had any problem with it
 It detected the SIM when installed and just works

PERFECTO
Nice
Well, The Phone's Description is very deceiving
 For a NOKIA product, you would expect a better quality phone
 But, instead, i received a very generic phone with similar abilities offered in such bargain phones created by BLU
 VERY DISAPPOINTED NOKIA, But i do not blame you, I blame Microsoft
 Bette Luck Next Time





The app store doesn't work
 Therefore, no WhatsApp

Was sent abroad, no feed back yet

is a Chinese product of very poor quality, this is a scam, it is not an original Nokia product, the price is not also worth the cover of the battery defective wine, in addition to last long in coming, not recommended at all the reputation of seller, I hope amazon punish him for mocking their customers

Works fine for what you need
I love it

I enjoy it
excelente
This Nokia phone is lightweight, has great call quality, and has a removable battery (something you don't find in smartphones these days), and a micro sd card slot
 I love how the phone lasts over 3 weeks on a single charge on light-moderate usage
 It comes with 3
5mm earphones and they have a microphone
 Overall, I really enjoy this phone but the only downside is that I couldn't find a setting to turn the brightness down but other than that it's a very good phone

This cell is not genuine Nokia , is a vulgar copy , battery came damaged , only brings three languages ​​and neither is Spanish , what the ad is a lie , honestly lost my money because this cell look like a toy 


 not the first time I buy cell by this route and really that's a joke

uo to now its dont have any problems
I bought this for my mother and she likes it

Not a bad phone when your not into smart phones

An OK basic phone for your young kids
 It is light but sturdy, looks good, has a good size screen with reasonable resolution and is simple to use
 It has a camera, bluetooth, radio and more
 I found the keypad somewhat small, with the keys grouped together tight, so might be hard for people with dexterity issues

did not work with our verizon plan had to send backsam phillips
This cell phone is everything it says , a long lifetime battery, a good signal range

 It's A shame that it does not allowed to use whatsapp

I liked this phone a lot
 The only thing I am not happy with is that I can't configure it in Spanish 'cause I bought this phone for her and She doesn't speak English, but the other features are good
I love the candy bar phones
 I want something simple and durable in a phone and I thought this would be an upgrade from my last phone
 I purchased a 16gb memory card to compliment it for music mostly
 I don't have a data plan so texting and calling were my main necessities
 After about 50 texts I have to delete them because there is no room to receive more


and that's with 15gb free on the memory card
 Messages cannot be saved to memory card so you are stuck with saving to the small phone memory
 Also, even though I have contacts in there, many of them just don't show up in my address book
 It's extremely odd, because there is no rhyme or reason to whose information will show and whose won't
 The people's numbers who have "disappeared" are still somewhere in the phone's memory because when they call or text me, their name will show up, but I just cannot access the information if I need their phone number
 I like the music player and the FM radio, it comes with a flashlight which is cool
 I have yet to set up the VPN to receive MMS and such, but I'm not sure I'm going to yet because it is pretty ridiculous that these basic functions of saving contacts and SMS messages is as sub par as it is
 If I am missing something, please let me know, but I see no way of being able to save your contacts or messages to an insertable memory card, and you are stuck then with the crappy memory of the phone
Perfect
works gpod
I have a several problems with this phone:First, it's not Nokia
 The cellphone that come to my house is a copy, it doesn't say "Nokia" inside (in the zone of the battery), the battery doesn't say Nokia neither
Second, the battery was in a bad state, it doesn't work, so I had to buy a new one, in that moment I noticed that the cellphone was a copy because the new battery say "NOKIA" and also has the official sticker
Finally, the phone doesn't have the option to capture video
The only thing that I have to confirm is if the internet and Whatsapp works
Very disappointed with this buy
 Should be an option of zero stars to use in this review

works great, easy setup, no problem with sim card

Awful



, the phone is not a genuine Nokia, is a cheap copy




Can receive calls and texts, all other applications are kind of inconvenient

This is a first for me
 I have never written a negative review in my life, however this begs to be the exception
 First of all, this appears to be a phone aimed primarily at the Caribbean market
 The primary language is Spanish on both the box and instructions
 There is also an English translation
I did note when researching the phone that there was a video review that noted the back cover was virtually impossible to remove
 I have had a number of phones with removable battery covers, but never like this one
 After trying a half hour with no success, I decided to return it
 I was concerned that further attempts to pry it off would damage it and render it nonreturnable
 The device is very small and very cheaply made I have been a Nokia admirer and user for years and I cannot believe this is a product of theirs - or Microsoft
 My advice is stay away even at this modest price
 It's a perfect example of getting what you pay for - in this case not even that

Good for what it is
 It is a 2G only phone, so if your carrier uses 3G for MMS, Internet, etc
 you are out of luck for any of that stuff
 Has a decent camera for a feature phone
 FM radio reception is marginal at best

Does the job

The Nokia 220 is a great little, basic phone
 Light weight and cool design
 Not a lot to it, but for a phone that is so inexpensive, it doesn't what it's supposed to
 Clear phone call quality and easy to use Nokia OS
 Makes me miss the good old days of "dumb phones"

Overall a good phone for the price
 There is no way to get rid of unwanted menu icons and the phone call quality is not what I expect from Nokia but the phone is durable

I like it this phone a lot
This phone is not unlocked
 I can't make calls
Great GSM phone
 Lite, well built, plenty of extras

The phone is working for now but it is so cheaply made I wonder how long it will last

An awesome unlocked cell phone
 I couldn't receive/send any images through at&t gophone service
 I took it into a retailer and they were able to fix it so I could send photos, the only problem is that it can't download large photo images from smartphones (and that's what everyone sends photos with these days)BATTERY IS AMAZING
 I can go a week or more without charging
I got a 32 GB memory card and I can play so much music from this phone, it's great
It calls/texts/plays music and that's all I need a phone to do

It never worked
 This did not work since I got out of its box, unfortunately I knew that on coming to Venezuela
 I don't return it because transportation is very expensive
if I could return at no cost I would do that, and buy my beloved Nokia C3-01
Very nice for a simple phone
 I purchased this for my brother who just wanted a simple phone but one that has an mp3 player and this one filled the bill
 He hasn't had any problem with it
 It detected the SIM when installed and just works

PERFECTO
Nice
Well, The Phone's Description is very deceiving
 For a NOKIA product, you would expect a better quality phone
 But, instead, i received a very generic phone with similar abilities offered in such bargain phones created by BLU
 VERY DISAPPOINTED NOKIA, But i do not blame you, I blame Microsoft
 Bette Luck Next Time





The app store doesn't work
 Therefore, no WhatsApp

Was sent abroad, no feed back yet

is a Chinese product of very poor quality, this is a scam, it is not an original Nokia product, the price is not also worth the cover of the battery defective wine, in addition to last long in coming, not recommended at all the reputation of seller, I hope amazon punish him for mocking their customers

Works fine for what you need
básico, pero muy bueno
Great
Perfect

nice, compact and durable
it's a low end phone with minimal options
 only two languages
 really

Not working in India
Bluetooth does not work for any other use than transferring the phonebook i guess
 It will pair with my cars and show the phonebook but not pass audio or calls through it or even when using a regular bluetooth headset
 Built in "apps" dont pass data at all, therefor useless but thats ok, i wanted to get rid of my Galaxy S5 and be less internet addicted
VERY light weigh, i'm always checking my pocket to see if i lost it
Feels like a toy
 Feels built solid though too, very strange when you hold it

Am so disappointed this phone is not unlock






Bought this phone as unlock but unfortunately is not very disappointed 




why state is unlock whiles is not 



not recommending no body to get this phone
Excellent

This phone is not unlocked as it says
 I first tried it in the USA and did not work
 Then l took it to overseas and still not working with any network
I have even been gone beyond to contact Nokia on it, the company said it does not have the software for this version to unlocked it
The most painful part of this deal is that, the phone is oversea and l can not return it for my money, because l bought it for my MOM in Africa
Never again should any unlocked phones be bought from this vendor
 I have regretted my purchase, l first knew Nokia phones were good brand to be trusted
Thank you

Darn hard to open the back cover; in fact, I couldn't open it without taking atool to it which would most likely ruin the product
 I had to return it for the Nokia X3-02 model, which I already have and the new one would be used for another carrier SIM card
 I am providing a review of my limited but informative experience
The 220 is bigger than it looks (I was hoping it would be the size of the Motorola Rockr (a well built phone--couldn't find batteries for it anymore))
 It is light and the complete back casing where the phone's face snaps into the rear housing-case is good at eliminating dirt and what-not that tends to get into the back of phones
 It feels like a $50 phone; buttons feels a little cheap--not cheap but a little cheap--like $50 cheap
 There is no open anywhere else other than for the charger and headphone jacks
 Here's the problem this phone posed for me that make it not workable for my purposes: I do not like to "transfer" my files on the SD micro card; I like to pop it out of the phone, insert it into a thumb USB drive and plug it into my computer to open (I avoid all the registering, logging in here and there, updates that and this, tracking me here and there, and all the other pain in the butt trailer tagging electronic vendors tie to your every move/use
 So access to the SD card is often and since I couldn't even open the back cover off to put the phone's battery it, (if you have joint problems or joint issues this phone is not for you) well, it wouldn't work for me
 It looks like a snap on video, but it's a serious impediment in real life, and I'm no weakling--I'm sure I could open it with the beyond normally required force, but I could have snap or break something inside rendering it less desirable
 If I have to exert more than normally required, it would not work for me who routinely removes the SD card
 For me, regardless of how well it functions, for my purposes, the hard to open back cover was the deal breaker
I already have a Nokia X3-02 and that's a great phone; really thin, super sleek; I don't care what phone you have, when I pull the X3-02 out, I get double looks
 I just didn't want to have two of the same, but it looks like that's my only option in the unlock GMS candy-bar style

Was shipped and delivered as promised
 The item served the purpose and it's easy to maneuver

Good cell phone

I enjoy it
excelente
This Nokia phone is lightweight, has great call quality, and has a removable battery (something you don't find in smartphones these days), and a micro sd card slot
 I love how the phone lasts over 3 weeks on a single charge on light-moderate usage
 It comes with 3
5mm earphones and they have a microphone
 Overall, I really enjoy this phone but the only downside is that I couldn't find a setting to turn the brightness down but other than that it's a very good phone

This cell is not genuine Nokia , is a vulgar copy , battery came damaged , only brings three languages ​​and neither is Spanish , what the ad is a lie , honestly lost my money because this cell look like a toy 


 not the first time I buy cell by this route and really that's a joke

uo to now its dont have any problems
I bought this for my mother and she likes it

Not a bad phone when your not into smart phones

An OK basic phone for your young kids
 It is light but sturdy, looks good, has a good size screen with reasonable resolution and is simple to use
 It has a camera, bluetooth, radio and more
 I found the keypad somewhat small, with the keys grouped together tight, so might be hard for people with dexterity issues

did not work with our verizon plan had to send backsam phillips
Came as expected
 Haven't used it yet but love it so far

Great GSM phone

The phone is working for now but it is so cheaply made I wonder how long it will last

Trying to find a replacement for my fantastic old Nokia 5310, I thought this would be as close as I could get — small, Nokia, candybar design
 Sadly, it was a significant step down
- Tinny sound (both incoming and outgoing)- No volume toggle (but then, that seems common in these cheaper models)- Feels flimsy- Low-res screenAnd most importantly: NOT compatible with bluetooth earpieces
 Oh, it has bluetooth, but only for syncing
 Go figure
Still three stars, as long as you know what you're getting into
 If you're just looking for a CHEAP phone that won't fall apart, it's better than BLU and some other low-end brands

didn't work in india
excellent product, good design, comfortable to wear, I recommend
Highly recommended

Not too happy because the black color phone, but I ordered white color

work well for the price sent it to a caribbean island 
 and my aunt love it

Good for what it is
 It is a 2G only phone, so if your carrier uses 3G for MMS, Internet, etc
 you are out of luck for any of that stuff
 Has a decent camera for a feature phone
 FM radio reception is marginal at best

Does the job

Great phone
 Very basic but excellent choice for a grandpa or grandma

nice
 was i expected

phone ringer and vibration wasn't working
 in addition the phone speaker was very weak that you can barely hear the voice
I returned the phone

Bought 2 phones to use in Asia and did not work
 Worst phone ever
 Throw in the trash
 Didn't bother to return

this is crazy, i have been waiting for this phone , it's been a month and a week i ordered this phone
Total disappointment
 I sold an imitation product that indicated in the original sale
 He says he is white and is not, what you sell is a product of black color and is not original 


 I lost 40 dollars in this deception
 I am very upset
 Would not recommend
excellent
excellte god
could not get it to receive pictures or send them either-i took it to an ATT center to no avail- i had to buy another phone
I wanted a cheap a nonsmart phone, and this phone works
 It is very basic, which is why it's cheap, but it is missing some stuff I would have assumed even a basic phone would have
 First, the bluetooth doesn't work with headsets or your car, it is only for transferring files with Nokia's "Slam" thing
 It also doesn't have any sort of memo/note pad/reminder thing (you can take audio memos, but who wants to do that
), you can just text yourself reminders
 There is 0 customization, can't delete, or move icons
 The audio player doesn't have any concept of albums, or even folders, every song is in one giant list
 This isn't too bad for me since I just keep it on random, which works well
 The internal memory is super small, although I haven't used it enough to hit that
 Even with a 32 GB SD card, you have to keep your messages on the phone, and they will fill it up quickly
The call quality is good enough, and the battery lasts about a week with light use (a few short calls and texts, and maybe 30 mins of music listening a day)
 I am using Ting in the US, they use T-Mobile's network
 So it works fine with them
Some other random notes: The charger that comes with it has the wire attached to the plug, it's not just a AC to USB adapter and then a USB cable
 The paper manual was in spanish, but the english version is online
 The FCC ID is: QTLRM-971, if you want to check that out
 It is, in fact, GSM 850/1900, even though all the stats I could find about this phone online said it was GSM 900/1800
 It doesn't vibrate when plugged in, keep that in mind if you try to test it when you first get it
 The case is totally smooth, I could see dropping it very easily, although I would expect it to survive
I will probably get a Nokia 301 from eBay, which is about twice as much, but fixes the problems I listed above
 I'm still giving 4 stars to this phone, since it was so cheap, and does work fine as a phone
One last note, there are some comments saying they get a Chinese knock off
 You have to check the rating of your seller, Amazon combines sellers for the same product on this page, so you never know who you are buying from unless you go up to the top of the page and check them out (and keep in mind it'll change often as the cheapest seller changes)
 For what is worth mine was legit
 Other customers have posted pictures of both the legit and fake boxes

I can't schang language
Excelent
This phone doesn't work as a GSM

Low signal with this phone, although for the price, I'm happy to say I bought as a back up phone

Excelente producto
Having used an iPhone for a few years, I was surprised when I ran out of memory for text messages on this phone
 Also, the only wired headset that works with it is the one that comes with it - a not-too-comfortable Nokia piece
Long battery life and clear voice calls make it a nice phone
 Just have to remember to delete messages every few days

Good phone
 It works in Dominican Republic
This cell phone is everything it says , a long lifetime battery, a good signal range

 It's A shame that it does not allowed to use whatsapp

I liked this phone a lot
 The only thing I am not happy with is that I can't configure it in Spanish 'cause I bought this phone for her and She doesn't speak English, but the other features are good
I love the candy bar phones
 I want something simple and durable in a phone and I thought this would be an upgrade from my last phone
 I purchased a 16gb memory card to compliment it for music mostly
 I don't have a data plan so texting and calling were my main necessities
 After about 50 texts I have to delete them because there is no room to receive more


and that's with 15gb free on the memory card
 Messages cannot be saved to memory card so you are stuck with saving to the small phone memory
 Also, even though I have contacts in there, many of them just don't show up in my address book
 It's extremely odd, because there is no rhyme or reason to whose information will show and whose won't
 The people's numbers who have "disappeared" are still somewhere in the phone's memory because when they call or text me, their name will show up, but I just cannot access the information if I need their phone number
 I like the music player and the FM radio, it comes with a flashlight which is cool
 I have yet to set up the VPN to receive MMS and such, but I'm not sure I'm going to yet because it is pretty ridiculous that these basic functions of saving contacts and SMS messages is as sub par as it is
 If I am missing something, please let me know, but I see no way of being able to save your contacts or messages to an insertable memory card, and you are stuck then with the crappy memory of the phone
Perfect
works gpod
I have a several problems with this phone:First, it's not Nokia
 The cellphone that come to my house is a copy, it doesn't say "Nokia" inside (in the zone of the battery), the battery doesn't say Nokia neither
Second, the battery was in a bad state, it doesn't work, so I had to buy a new one, in that moment I noticed that the cellphone was a copy because the new battery say "NOKIA" and also has the official sticker
Finally, the phone doesn't have the option to capture video
The only thing that I have to confirm is if the internet and Whatsapp works
Very disappointed with this buy
 Should be an option of zero stars to use in this review

works great, easy setup, no problem with sim card

Awful



, the phone is not a genuine Nokia, is a cheap copy




Can receive calls and texts, all other applications are kind of inconvenient

This is a first for me
 I have never written a negative review in my life, however this begs to be the exception
 First of all, this appears to be a phone aimed primarily at the Caribbean market
 The primary language is Spanish on both the box and instructions
 There is also an English translation
I did note when researching the phone that there was a video review that noted the back cover was virtually impossible to remove
 I have had a number of phones with removable battery covers, but never like this one
 After trying a half hour with no success, I decided to return it
 I was concerned that further attempts to pry it off would damage it and render it nonreturnable
 The device is very small and very cheaply made I have been a Nokia admirer and user for years and I cannot believe this is a product of theirs - or Microsoft
 My advice is stay away even at this modest price
 It's a perfect example of getting what you pay for - in this case not even that

This is a basic cellphone, it actually seems to be genuine Nokia
 IT IS NOT FROM CHINA, at least mine isn't
 It sais "Made in Vietnam"
 A little bit curious 'couse I always thought Nokia was from Thailand, but I love it
 Does the basic things of a cellphone, not too much laggy when you writte text messages, I haven't wrote larger text messages, but so far so good
 Works perfect in Venezuela
 Earphones sounds as classic as Nokia always have been, sounds kinda loudy, wich is good when you are on your way to the University or to Work and you don't want to listen anything than your music
Anyways, the only thing I'm praying is I wish this phone has a long life lasting typical of Nokia


I'm gonna add a few photos of the cellphone, I hope it can help you to make a better choice
 I'm kinda picky when I'm buying things on the internet, and that's why I want to help people like me
 Good Luck

Very disappointed with this phone for two main reasons; 1 in the specs it has blue tooth however that is not true, the Bluetooth only will transfer data not connect with a head set
2 the profiles for the ringtones don't save your preferences, so every time I put the phone in silent it still rings
Phone is network locked, hate to say "i trusted those people"
Excellent product recommend to the community
 Cheers
Don't working
 Network so is garbej
 Money is garbej because is not working

Bought this for my wife, who tends to ignore her phones until she needs them

 Tried AT&T and they said the phone is locked

Just got mine in the mail today and I love it
 Get a mini sd card for your storage needs and you're in business (the phone itself has very little storage)
 The trickiest part is setting up MMS so you can send/receive pictures, but it can be done
 I found probably the best tutorial on how to get this set up here : http://www

com/att_gophone_mms_settings_on_nokia_220/
Excellent Luddite phone, perhaps the best currently available in US
 I had an old candybar phone that died about a year ago
 It was awesome, the battery would last 5-7 days
 I've been searching for a comparable phone ever since, and have investigated dozens of feature phones
 With most, despite assurances to the contrary, the battery wouldn't last much more than a day
 But the battery on this one lasts for days 


Pros:--battery life--solid voice quality--quick and smooth operating system--good predictive texting--threaded text messages--simple mp3 player--flashlight--web browser so slow you'll never be tempted to use it--little 2mp camera good enough for quick, unimportant picsCons:--has web browser--buttons a bit small (though I have huge hands and don't really have a difficult time navigating the buttons)--can't delete apps from menu--AT&T about to take down 2g network, leaving only TMobile's
This phone is not very good
 Keep in mind it's the OLD SCHOOL texting kind of set up where you have to scroll through the letters so if you text a little or a lot keep that in mind
 Yes it's a basic phone but the sound is horrible when talking on it and I get no bars all the time
 Even if you are looking for something basic I say spend a little more and go with a better phone
The phone is not working with the SIM card
 Unfortunately, I'm too far away to return now
 DO NOT BUY THIS PROSUCT

I am giving this cell phone 5 stars and it's proof Nokia should have continued making cell phones
I bought this as a gift for my mother, she wanted a basic phone to make and receive calls
 She doesn't like touchscreens
After looking for something for her, I came upon this cell phone and it has been a great purchase
Good:° Good build quality (It's Nokia afterall)
° Good call reception
 My mother says she hears clearly when talking on the phone
 No issues with signal
° Keypad is comfortable and responsive
Not So Good:° The screen could have been designed with a better resolution
Some people have stated they received a knock-off
 It's important to remember to buy only from sellers with solid reputation
 I did and I received the phone on time and with no issues
5 stars because at this price ($35) there's no way you're going to get something better
 The best phone for people who just want a basic phone to make and receive calls
 Recommended
excellent product, thanks

Good
perfect
Regular
Don't have options for languages

This phone complete garbage worst one i ever bought, it didn't pick up signal at all, i had to return it back to amazon

I bought this item last year and took it to Africa where I discovered was not unlocked phone because it could not work
 I asked them to send it back to USA and I have it now
 How are going to help me for the manufacturer to fix this problem

Excellent product
Perefect
My phone was damage 1 week before I received
 Really bad choice

ok
i love
excelente
Nice
Simple phone that does the trick if you just need to talk and text
 Can't beat the price

Excellent cellphone




It never worked
 This did not work since I got out of its box, unfortunately I knew that on coming to Venezuela
 I don't return it because transportation is very expensive
if I could return at no cost I would do that, and buy my beloved Nokia C3-01
Very nice for a simple phone
 I purchased this for my brother who just wanted a simple phone but one that has an mp3 player and this one filled the bill
 He hasn't had any problem with it
 It detected the SIM when installed and just works

PERFECTO
Nice
Well, The Phone's Description is very deceiving
 For a NOKIA product, you would expect a better quality phone
 But, instead, i received a very generic phone with similar abilities offered in such bargain phones created by BLU
 VERY DISAPPOINTED NOKIA, But i do not blame you, I blame Microsoft
 Bette Luck Next Time





The app store doesn't work
 Therefore, no WhatsApp

Was sent abroad, no feed back yet

is a Chinese product of very poor quality, this is a scam, it is not an original Nokia product, the price is not also worth the cover of the battery defective wine, in addition to last long in coming, not recommended at all the reputation of seller, I hope amazon punish him for mocking their customers

Works fine for what you need
Very good and user friendly phone
good product but i was kind of difficult to use the facebook app at the beggining
It is not unlocked








The phone is not working
 I gifted to my friend who is in India
 The phone isn't working

excellent product
Bought for my 85 years old mother in law as a non-touch phone
 Works ok for her
 Works perfectly in Venezuela
EXCELLENT
excellent
Very pleased
 Excellent seller
Muy bien
Relative overseas loves this
 Works in Africa (Orange)

I'm interested in finding a case for this item
I must complement the supplier and seller of their handling and shipping policy
 As of today the phone is working in excellent order and I have no complaints

I bought this phone for my mother who lives in Thailand but was visiting here in the States
 The phone was easy to use and I slotted both her Thailand GSM Simcard and purchased a GSM simcard from Walmart Mobile to use here stateside
 I was able to label the SIM cards as Thailand and USA so that when my mom would dial out a number the phone would prompt and ask my mom which SIM card to attempt
 This was a little annoying but it was easy to choose the correct SIM Card after labeling them
 The only other annoying thing was that her Thai sim card had address book entries on it that were "local" dialed numbers while in Thailand but while here in the states she either was forced to edit her address book entries to add the +1 country code options to dial those same numbers
 I opted instead to just add new entries into her local USA SIM card to keep the separated since she would have the same exact problem in reverse when she got back to Thailand
The phone is Quad Band with Dual SIM support so it it's a fantastic solution for an overseas traveler visiting the USA or vice versa
 The only real complaint that I have from a usability perspective would be that the buttons are kind of tiny and my mother would frequently mute the call by accident while answering an inbound call
This phone is only 40 some odd dollars
 For the money I spent on it I can't complain much at all
 The battery cover is easy to remove but I do it breaking if you're a power user with a spare battery and you want to constantly swap the batteries out with a fresh one
 The FM radio also works very well and it's a nice feature if you're into FM radio
I don't review phones often but if you're looking for a cheap (dare I say disposable) phone that you can use with two SIM cards that is Dual or Quad Band this is your phone
 Buy two of them
 It would make a great hot spare if you have to have your 600 dollar whatever phone serviced or lost

I'm still happy about my purchase
 But there are some things that I must warn people who are considering to buy it
 The overall quality is good enough to satisfy you, but the OS is just a disaster
 This is not like normal Nokia we have known
 There so many lacking and missing functions and it is super sluggish when writing text
 Buy it if you don't care about these
 But, I still like this phone so far

Item was as good as described
 Delivered on schedule and works as expected - World Phone


Language for menu can be set to English
 BUT not for predictive text

 How incongruent that is
I posted it 3 days ago at Amazon feedback but no reply yet

not quadbandaccording to the manual that comes with it in the box, it only works on GSM 900/1800 frequencies
Best model of basic phone ever
Great battery life too
If a simple/basic phone is needed & you can find this model new & unlocked it is a terrific choice

nokia is a great phone
it worked, and I sent it to Jamaica can had a plan put on it , no problems 






 @@@
Love the phone but it doesn't have a flashlight

Not unlocked for sure 

excellent
it was small, easy to use and very useful for international travelling
 the sim changing part was very easy while on journey

phone is locked with other network provider
 I cant use the phone with my international sim card
 please send unlocking code
 please
 the advertisement says unlock

 please provide me an unlocking code

thnks
This is a very good, simple and functional phone
 Nokia always makes strong and reliable phones
 The only problem I have with it, the description says that the phone has a flashlight and radio but does have a flashlight and to use the radio you need a headset, I don't know if is because I received the T-Mobile version or because of the seller
 Otherwise than that, the phone has good battery life, very clear headset speaker and back speaker is pretty loud, screens real bright and clear along with good display of colors
 Ships fast and received fast even on standard shipping got the phone in 2days
 This is really good for traveling and if you work challenge jobs, so you don't need to fiddle through menus and apps like a smart phone

The quality is good, as an used cell phone with a low price, the quality exceeds my expecation
Good package
 What's more, a additional charger is provided, which give me a surprise 
Thank you

Was excited when I saw the old NOKIA and removed it from package and though out the box
 Bought for my mom who just wanted to replace an old basic phone- Bought phone because it said it was unlocked as I wanted to send to another country
 Turns out that she has to pay to unlock this phone and it will only work on one of the networks which is the one she is not signed up with
 This is disappointing as she has to spend more money to buy another phone

it is not a unlocked phone 
 only works for T mobile
 I went to walmart and bought an Att sim card but it didnt work

Product for the money
 Works with sim card
 Cannot recieve pictures tho from a third party even though The phone can take pictures
 very odd
 Ah well

I wanted a light-weight phone with a FM radio
 This Nokia has good reception w/ T-mobile, and the volume is good
 The best feature is the FM radio
 The antenna provided by Nokia is weak, so I recommend using an alternate - any 2
5mm headset will work fine
 Just for comparison, I spent $300 on my previous phone, a light-weight Samsung phone w/ FM radio
 I was disappointed with the Samsung - the phone itself was fine, but it used proprietary adaptors limiting my headset options
 I bought 3 Samsung headsets, and all produced too much static for the FM radio to be useful

A very nice phone to have
 Nothing complicate it
 Nokia makes very nice phones
Nokia'sphones are cool,
 This one in particular I personally think that is the bestmodel

I purchased this phone because I needed a solid battery life and talking phone for college
 I also purchased this phone because it works with the Nokia PC Suite software, which allows me to control the phone from my computer for tasks such as writing SMS messages and managing my contacts
 This phone has bluetooth which works wonderfully
 I've tested the range of the bluetooth to be about 17 feet
 It is very reliable and I have not had any disconnect issues with the bluetooth
 The camera on this phone is quite basic, but it works if you are willing to wait for it to load
 I was shocked how wonderful the phone was when I opened the box
 You get a pair of headphones and a charger with the phone when you purchase it

I am not sure if it was a fluke or if it happens often but I ordered a phone, when it arrived it was not the correct phone
 The phone that was sent is definately nicer but it had no backing to hold the sim/battery in


 Not sure what happened but I am def
 not pleased with this
 I automatically was sent instructions for mailing the item back which now I have to pay for shipping and handling again for this phone and then hopefully I will get my money back

 We will see
 I have never had this happen before and shop often on Amazon as a prime member

I had purchased this as a gift for my father-in-law back in India
 My wife used it for few mots as our secondary phone
 The speakers are not that loud enough to notice a incoming call
The build quality is ok as expected from Nokia
Unfortunately this product did not work in India due to band difference and now it is used as a paper weight in India

I like its simplicity to use which is exactly what I wanted to have
 However, sometimes there is difficult in hearing voices

This phone says it has flashlight but it doesnt and when i received the package it wasnt the s40 version it just said nokia 2330
 so i returned it

I have I very good review for the Milestone, but this another was a gift (for someone that cannot use a smartphone)But this just start the logo and then goes out
sorry for my english =P
This phone does all I expect of it for the price
 I bought this as a temporary phone & it did a satisfactory job; no drop calls & a clear enough signal

I bought 2 of them from Amazon
 I received them but they were not unlocked, I had to pay separately to unlock them
Besides this, the phone is fine
 Very basic, but is what I need for a low price
Update:After using the phone for 1 month, I meet my expectations
 The signal is good, the volume is great, and the phone looks very good, not cheap made
 The camera is not powerful, but anyway I see it as a plus
 The radio works fine
 If you want a phone that works good for SMS and calls, and do not want to spend more than $50, I think this is the best you can get for the price

Today I inquire about that I have not receive the item yet; but wait no need to sent another order, because it was not lost in transit
 Mail-Box Etc
 our carrier, send me an E-mail, arriving and confirm the cell phone and documents
Why

 It has a FLASHLIGHT
 Thanks
 Doctor

The phone is good only for talking
 No applications or games work on it
 All keep asking for a smart chip


waste of money
Everything looks good with the product except that the title of the ad is incorrect
 There is no FM Radio feature in the phone

It was kind of bruised and it looked kind of old but I guess the important thing is that it works

I took out of country to used but I cannot used because they told me it's not unlocked
works great
Received product as described quickly

Happy
This is not an unlocked phone
Product is in great condition

It works fine in the US, but is incompatible with the service in Israel, where I was thinking of using it

MY HUSBAND LOVES THIS PHONE
 I GOT THIS ONE FOR A SPARE WHILE I COULD
 DELIVERED ON TIME AND AS PROMISED
 EXCELLENT SERVICE

This phone became a hand-me-down
 I upgraded, my mom kept it
 She washed it I don't know how many times in the washer and it just keeps working
 Dropped it, sat on it, left it in extreme temperatures, stepped on it, etc
Guess all the stereotypical jokes about the nokias being indestructible are true huh

It is not a gsm phone ,I bought it and could not use it in africa,it just did not work
I bought this as a gift for a 12 year old and it definitely served its purpose
 No complaints
Excellent Nokia phone
 I bought it for its longer than normal battery life
 I encountered no problem to activate it
 In less than 30 minutes, after receiving it, It was up and running
 I will encourage anyone in search for a non-android phone to purchase this Nokia
 Thanks

Nice phone at this price
Well worth the money, nice little cell phones with no fancy features, just a telephone to have in your pocket

It will break easily
 It is a good phone when you need something small and you don't want to carry anything bulky

Unless your looking for something extremely cheap, and a little more on the old style, don't get this

 Phone is TINY and definitely NOT up-to-date

We bought this phone for travel outside of the USA
 It worked perfectly for us
 All we needed were SIM cards for the countries we traveled to and we were set
 We saved ourselves from paying international phone rates within the countries we visited
 Our families could call us from the USA by SKYPE or other methods and we were easily available to them
 This phone will be with us for future travel as well

Excellent dealer
 Glad to purchased the brand from you
 Looking to deal with you in future

Sometimes the signal seems weak on this phone for AT&T in San Francisco
 My old Nokia seemed to have stronger signal
 But overall, I think it's a very good unlocked, world phone for the price
 Easy to use with a nice, clear graphic interface
 I'm looking forward to trying it while traveling abroad and using foreign SIM cards
The phone I received was slightly different that the product photo
 My phone has some Chinese-looking characters on some buttons of the keypad
 But it's subtle and looks ok to me

Cell phone arrived, but the codes IMEI and unlocking were not correct 
 You can not unlock the cell phone

Terrible phone
 My mom can't hear anyone on this phone
 It's junky

In perfect condition
THEY AD SAID WITH BIG LEETERS UNLOCKED AND ISNOT
perfect phone for a guy like me cause i don't use my phone for anything else but a phone, if i wanted a computer i would use my computer not my phone
 so with that being said calls are clear simple to use buttons are large what more can you ask for in a phone

Great little phone, perfect for what like needed
 Small light, I hardly notice it in my pocket
 I would recommend this product to all

Just wanted it for parts and it served my purpose
 I had the same phone with a worn-out keypad surface

I purchased this phone about a month ago as a gift for my husband
 Delivery time was great, no problems there
 When it comes to mobile phones Nokia always strikes me as being one of the most durable at a reasonable price, hence the reason my attention went straight for the Nokia phone because any mobile phone owned by my husband really needs to stand the test of durability as he doesn't take much care in protecting it
 This phone actually looks nicer in real than online
 It's unlocked, and I'm outside the US, and it was quite easy, I just slip in the sim and it worked perfectly with the local network
 I haven't checked out thoroughly the quality of pics as yet, but my only disappointment so far is that I didn't get a USB cable with it
 So if you're looking for a nice, sleek looking phone on a budget, this is it



I received this item on time and it was as pictured and perfect for my grandma
 The only problem I have is that it says it was an unlocked phone but I didn't not receive the unlock code
 I will try to take it somewhere else to try to unlock it
 The missing unlock code is the only problem I have with this phone

If you want a simple flip phone without the bells and whistles of the more common phones that have internet, ect
 than this if for you
 It has great simple features
 It has an extra loud ringer setting and an option for a simultanious ringer/vibration setting which I like best
 On other flip phones, it's either or
 Great price too
 I love this phone

I got this phone for my mother
 It's suitable for her because of the big keys and numbers
 It's easy to use
 It has a lot of features but she isn't really that technology savvy so answering and making calls is all that she needs it for
 I've always liked products by Nokia

I BOUGHT THIS PHONE AS A GIFT FOR MY MOTHER
 I ORDERED IT IN BLACK AND RECEIVED A BLUE PHONE
 THIS IS MY ONLY COMPLAINT AS MY MOTHER LOVES A NOKIA FLIP

This is the only phone that I know how to use and my old one broke
 Thank you for your help

The quality of the phone was fine, I assume
 Couldn't use it because they didn't send me the right one
 Oh well, it was time to join the smartphone generation anyway

I like a phone that is perfect for the basic user
 I like the time that show up when it is closed
 My only problem is the battery doesn't stay charged very long and the volumn isn't quite as loud as I would like

Nokia is a very easy to handle, the soft keyboard is not complicated
 has dictionary which facilitates the insertion of words
It is ok but not as good as my 7 yr old Nokia that started to fall apart
 The calls are not clear
 I am considering duck taping my old phone together
 I don't care what they look like

The phone does not have a vibrate function and had a hard time keeping signal
 It was good for listening to music though

Every thing is OK besides the fact that it wasn't unlocked and I can't use it


 The information was misleading

I ordered this flip phone for my husband because of its size (large) in the design it is larger than most flip phones out there
 Also he can check the date and time by opening and closing the phone

Phone is good

 but its not unlocked
i was out of country and could not use it



 when they say unlock they should give a unlock one



I got to use with Roshan in Afghanistan; but it won't work
 So maybe unlocked; but only works in America
 I'm out $60 and can't even return due to Li battery
 Total loss

First off It read it was a T-Mobile Flip which is what I needed, as it turned out it was an ATT and it was blocked
The phone came locked and I was unable to get it unlocked
 It was advertised as an unlocked cell phone

GOOD
This is an old style phone
 It's what I wanted
 Simple, reliable, clear sound
 I don't use the camera
 Clam shell allows me to check the time by flipping open briefly then shutting
 I have had no trouble connecting or with dropped calls although that is often the carrier and not the cell phone
These are old fashioned phones that perform the intended function of a phone
 Talking to people

Thanks you
I got this phone because its the same as my old phone
 Its great
 I use to it
 I wanted a flip phone because i have a lawn service, so it fold and stay in my pocket

I got this for my husband as he always misplace / lost his phone
 Good to buy a cheaper one for him
 He still using it until now
only holds power for 15 hours (even when not used)Camera doesn't work as good as expected, and the thing, that protects the camera, fell of the first day
I got this phone for my mom and although it has been going strong since I bought it, I believe it was used since we have had some problems with utilizing it

I checked in with T-Mobile to make sure the problem is not the Sim Card
 We put a new one, problem was not solved
 Then, we made sure the phone is unlocked
 However, T-Mobile was not able to help solving this problem with the connection/reception
I am not able to use this phone in the United States due to lock of connectivity
 T-Mobile advised me the phone must have a different frequence most likely for Europe or Asia
 I am not happy with this purchase

-Black,blue and grey cellphone-Blue display
-Mirror and matt finish
-At&t logo
-Generic battery lid,is grey with matt finish
-Generic battery [one hour


never finish to load]-Unlocked
 [this cellphone don't give me access i only can look the battery load
It is a good product I had one before I love it, that is why I bougth againg, but this one I got, came break, I have to take to the service to repair, because had trouble the microphone, it is not audible, I can not hear the person who is speaking and the problem is I live in other country 



 I got it while I went to U
S
A
Product arrived fast
 Item is a gift for an older women and she is quite happy
 Simple phone for those not wanting complicated phones
 Also a rare find to find a flip which doesn't allow for accidental dialing

I was just looking for a nice phone for my aunt
 She is more than 60 and she can barely see the screen of most cell phones
 Thank God she loved this one


 all she needs to do is read the sms, answer and make phone calls


 ohhhh she also wanted to listen to music on it
 This cell phone is pretty easy to use for her


 numbers on screen are quite big, and she can listen to the radio on it


 the camera is ok for the price

Wanted a TALK phone and Nokia has the Power for Towers
User friendly,individual keys
 Only drawback


ringer is not loud enough because I work outside on a boat

Bought this for my husband, he wanted a flip phone
 There are not many to choose from, this Nokia turned out to be a very nice phone gets great service and is easy to set up
Was worried about buying from a company other than T-Mobile but I have to say the phone was new and came boxed with a charger

Purchased this for my elderly mother
Pro-screen is good sizefairly easy to use if you do not have eyesight issuesswitch out mini sim card for easy set up
ConsMenu button is not easy to use
 Other phones have easy to read arrows for menu navigation
 This one does not
 You have to press the side of the button in the direction you want to move in
 If they had arrow or directional buttons it would definitely be easier for someone with nimble fingers or poor eyesight
Our phone must have been refurbished or used because the voice mail was registered to someone else
 very strange since I thought voicemail set up was determined by your sim card/service provider

Easy to use, light, good shape to carry on the pocket
 Good quality for the price
Negative: to conserve battery the phone shuts off the display until you open it, which means that you can't see the hour or if you have a missed call or a message
Overall, I am satisfied
The phone was fine, and Amazon service as always was great


 but it did not work in my country :(, my mistake


Actually I am rating this as 5 due to Amazon reliability, excellent prices, great customer service and schedule adherence
 Amazon ROCKS



very simple phone to use
 I bought this phone for my mom because she is getting to the older side of the age
 She needed a keypad that was easy to look at, and for phone use only


no texting etc
 She likes it
 Cant complain yet

a reliablie machine
Having this phone for only a day leaves me with the impression that all I will be doing will be making phone calls with it
 What jumps out at me is the poor screen resolution and weak display
 The phone is replacing a Nokia 6133 that was used for calls, texts and an occasional game
 The 6133 had a solid display that was easily read for the occasional text message and navigating through the menus
 The 2720 screen is terrible, I can hardly make out anything that is on it and I dread the task of entering contact information
Since my needs are basic I think that the 2720 will be adequate but I will not be raving about how a good a phone it is
I will follow up with more if anything stands out after more use
There was no problem with entering contact information, worked out just fine

I bought this as a gift for my husband who has a sim card with a pay and go phone with another company
T Mobile wants me to use T Mobile I guess and his sim card won't work in this phone
 It reads the card but says no network service
Doesn't unlocked mean you can exchange sim cards back and forth
I am very disappointed

i got this phone today and it was locked 






 dont buy it and i want refund now 
































 thats it
I tried to order the correct phone twice and both times it came in with a TMobile connection
 There was a message that refused to be deleted
 The ad didn't say anything about this
 I am an ATT customer and the phone is advertised as being compatible

They say you get what you paid for and this phone is just that
 Unless I shouted, no one can hear me, maybe every other word that I said
 Save your money and buy something that works better

I am living overseas and have tried and spent money trying to unlock this phone, it did not unlock and now I am here without a phone

this was a replacement for my husbands 3 yr old Nokia
 He just uses it as a phone nothing else
 Cancelled his land phone
this is a good phone if that's all you want it for
 the only drawback for him is that he's a bit hard of hearing and the volume is at it's highest and he still thinks it's a bit too low
 other than that it works great with no problems whatsoever

DOES NOT WORK WITH AT&T
 I bought this phone as a replacement for my aunt
 She had this phone for about a year & broke after being accidently submerged in water
 After looking at other replacement phones, she said she really wanted one just like what she had
 If you buy from ATT it's about $200, so I found this one that claimed to worked with ATT
 Well it doesn't & I'm not happy
 RETURNING ASAP

The phone sets itself up nicely
 Voice mail seems to automatically set itself up, unlike the korean phones which leave the basic user with a 'voice mail has not been set up' message
I bought the phone for a housemate who wants a simple phone
 She cannot hear the ringer and misses calls
 This is a problem, it is too quiet

I bought this phone as a temporary phone to use until my contract was up and I could get a free phone
 First off the phone took 2 weeks to arrive and when it finally arrived I found out it was a refurbished phone (which was never mentioned)The box the phone came in was ripped up and contents were cheaply wrapped in plastic that is how I knew it was refurbished
 The phone itself sucks, it is very difficult to hear anyone or for anyone to hear me while speaking on it
 The cover on the back that goes over the battery is a thin flimsy piece of plastic which constantly falls off while in my pocketbook and the battery falls out
 The camera on it is horrible, I had less expensive phones that had much better picture quality then this phone
 Another thing is when you want to get back to main screen simply closing phone won't do it
 You have to push end several times to get back to main screen
 When I close phone after phone call it is still connected unless I press exit or end
 Same thing goes for texting it will leave you on text you wrote or recently read, simply closing phone won't bring you back to main menu
 When using the speaker phone option you can't initiate speaker until the other party answers which is very annoying
 I'm going to keep it as a desperation back-up phone, because it took so long to get to me I don't want the headache of sending it back

It is a good, basic phone
 It looks inexpensive (i
e
 cheap), particularly the keyboard, but everything works just fine, which is more than I can say for the last two phones I bought for my wife that cost a lot more
 The inside and outside displays are bright and clear
 It is two months old now
 Assuming that it holds up, if she breaks it or looses it, I will probably buy another just like it
My only complaint is that the microphone suffers from the weird problem that cheap cell phones tend to have - that noises originating from 10-15 feet away from the phone come through much louder than the voice of the person holding the phone
 This makes it impossible to talk to someone in a crowded room, or even someone who has a TV playing in the background
 For this reason, she tends to use her bluetooth headset any time she talks on this phone

70 dollars, cheep, right
 believe me it looks veeeryyy cheep too
 it is like a plastic toy, maybe good for 14 year old girls
 i ordered black from JandR, i got blue

 bad service, cheep phone made in China




 nokia and made in China


 what a shame
 Bad reception too
 Save money
 buy smth else


 unless u r a 14 year old girl




Nokia 2720 flip phone is total junk
 The first one stopped working after 3 months (wouldn't charge), and the same thing happened with the second one, 10 days after it was eligible for return
 Easy to use, but poorly made
 Will buy a different brand this time

I needed a phone for my child and wanted a starter phone
 I am using the phone with AT&T and got the SIM card from them and worked without issues
Pros:CostEasy to useSturdyTexting supportCamera (not the best)Con:Does not work with the micro Cells (they require 3g Phone)Most of the games require Internet accessPower cable is not standard (i
e
 not USB)Signal Strength not the bestNo wifi support (only listing this as most things on the phone want the internet to do)On a side note
 You cannot get MMS (Picture Messaging) without having the data plan on AT&T even if you have unlimited texting family plan, because they said it requires data for pictures, but if you turn data on almost anything you do on the phone needs the data plan


 The "back" button on the phone at the top level is internet access so you would press that even if you were not trying to get on the internet




I bought it in US
 it was working fine with ATT
 It is not working with India SIM cards


Need solution



 :)
I got this product in a very good price; also I've never had problems with this brand
 Shipped very fast, and the most important thing, my dad loved the present

This is a fine phone when you do not need all the additional services that have been added for online function
 Bluetooth is the only necessity, and it works well

When we get the phone and try to put another sim Card doesn't workWe use different companies Sim Card and didn't workwe had to pay to ulocked
used this phone for about a month, then it suddenly has problem hearing when people call
 can't hear anything from the other person

Product is very easy to use right out of the package
 For a person just looking for a simple phone to use, this one is it
 Screen is big enough to see with the text, but small enough so that it doesn't bulge in your pocket

Need Help about this product
 It`s not working in my country and I don't know why
,I`m in Costa Rica, and when I made a purchase I saw that it was unlocked
,ANY body help me with that
 what can I do
 PLease
I have lived in 2 different areas where my Samsung SGH-E335 and my SGH-T109 both had poor reception
 I constantly had problems with dropped calls, poor call quality, etc


 The SGH-T109, which I was still using and still works, also had a very poor headset which I lost
 The replacement headset was even worse
 See my review at Wireless Solutions Earbud for Samsung SGH-T929 Memoir, SGH-A877 Impression, SGH-T119, SGH-T109
The SGH-T109 reception got so bad I finally had to replace it with this Nokia 2720 S40 unlocked phone
 I had previously called T-Mobile and they wanted me to sign a contract for another 2 years for yet another Samsung phone and, for some reason which I am not sure why, another SIM card
 BTW, I bought the Samsung T139 Prepaid Phone (T-Mobile) as a gift for someone else and it has the same problem, poor reception
 WHEN is Samsung going to make a basic flip-phone which has better reception
I took a chance and bought this Nokia 2720 S40 unlocked phone and it works


 basically
 Now instead of having no bars, at least I get 1 or 2 bars and the other party can understand me
 The Nokia is also a better looking phone with silver buttons and a blue case
 Unfortunately, the Nokia, compared to the Samsung, has a strange menu system where it is difficult to find basic setup commands or the settings don't exist at all
 Also, when I have the phone open, the timed backlight goes off and when I press any button to make it go back on, the button registers on the phone as a command, forcing me to exit whatever I entered
 I find this most irritating
There is no mention of a headset on the Amazon description page but a wired headset is included
 The Nokia wired headset is better than Samsung's with clearer sound
 All I need is a basic cellphone
 I don't need a worthless, lousy, 1
3 megapixel cellphone camera since I already have a Canon PowerShot SX210IS 14
1 MP Digital Camera with 14x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3
0-Inch LCD (Black)
 I'm not going to pay megabucks to access the Internet with my phone because I have a laptop and a desktop for that
 When I'm traveling, if I want to access the 'Net, I can get FREE access using my laptop and WiFi at most motels, many coffee shops, and many small restaurants
 I also do not use texting because I don't want to pay 15¢ per spam message
 I use FREE emails instead
I hope this Nokia will last for at least 3 years
 I'll never go back to Samsung cells again
 I doubt Samsung will ever get their act together regarding basic flip-phones
 BTW, Samsung doesn't really like even remotely, partially (3/5 star) negative reviews of their products so they don't always post them on their own website
 They like positive, happy, reviews
 Just wanted to let you know
See my PIC's and notes in this product's image section

If you just want to talk and text with this phone, it is ideal
 It does not have a lot features
 It is easy to carry as a second phone

The phone is a great has an alarm clock, calendar, calculator, ad camera
 My only problem is that I am an ATT user and it will not accept MMS messages ( picture mail or fwds) it asks you to retrieve message, but will not open it
 So if you don't mind not being able to receive MMS messages it's a great phone

As an ATT user, we ordered this unlocked phone for my husband who wanted something similar to his old Nokia, which is going on 5 years old and dying a slow death
 He loves the simplicity of the phone and ease of use
 It worked right out of the box, he is not a tech savvy guy and caught on right away
Unfortunately, although this phone was unlocked


 it had been made for T-mobile
 It will text and call, but will not send or receive photos


 not matter how hard the people at unlockedcellphonekings tried to help me, it was no use
So if you have a T-Mobile chip and want a simple unlocked reliable phone for pictures, texting and calling


 this is great
 If you have an ATT chip and don't care about pictures


 this is great
 If you want to get pictures of your grandkids and have ATT


 don't get it
On the upside, the phone support at unlockedcellphonekings was wonderful
 They were very patient, helpful and easy to talk to
 I would definitely consider using them again even though this particular phone isn't quite what we needed

It's not the best phone, but fot that prize makes a good purchase
 It covers the basic need for communication in a cool style cheap phone

Pros: Solid build, thin, bluetooth enabled, very customizable
Cons: No sd-card, no usb
This is the best built flip phone I've used
 Very solid, and easy to customize all the tones and styles
 I've generally had much better luck with the build of Nokia phones than other flip phones
 I used the older model of their flip phone to death; this new one is much thinner and looks way better than what you'd usually get for the price
 Also I was very happy this came unbranded
 A lot of times you end up with stupid ATT or TMobile junk on the phone
 This was a clean product straight from Nokia
 This is exactly what I was hoping for

This item could not read SIM cards (one of the NOKIA service centers tagged it as manufacturer's defect)
 I am trying to fix it
 Would let you know what happens next

For those who want a smart looking phone without all the razmataz features that require a PHD to learn, the Nokia 2720 is a good choice

Nice phone, perfect size for purse, great color
 Good ring tones, easy flip open
 I don't want a lot of service on my phone, don't text, don't access internet but this phone has those options
 I had to send it back though
 It does not do voice activation for blue tooth
 Just because a phone states it is bluetooth compatible it does NOT mean it will do voice activation which was crucial to me
 I want to be able to just hit my bluetooth button and say "home" and have it dial home
 What is the point of having a bluetooth if you can't do that
 You can dial manually and then set the phone down and be hands free or you can answer a call with the bluetooth but you can't actually "call" anyone via the tooth unless the phone does Voice Recognition or Voice Activation
 You need to look for those words in the description if that is what you are looking for

I was looking for a simple cellphone
 This vendor had one that was inexpensive and arrived very quickly
 Works fine
 Kudos

Nokia 2720 flip cell phone will not except ROGERS sim card,there for useless to me
 Amazon should have told me that US and Canada dont have the same set up

The product is good but it'll not do me any good if it's not unlocked as advertised
when you're selling a product , always try to deliver what you promised
I ordered this cell phone with the understanding that it was an UNLOCKED US VERSION Nokia 2730 flip phone
 What I received was a LOCKED flip phone that was shipped from Singapore
 I spent 8 hours at two different AT&T stores trying to get this phone to work



they even replaced my SIM card twice while I was at the store


but to no avail


the phone would not work
 I contacted Amazon, and they contacted the seller
 I returned the phone for a refund but the clincher is the returned phone had to be sent to Israel which makes me a little uncomfortable since the phone came from one foreign country and had to be returned to another foreign country
 Amazon has assured me I will get my money back




but I guess I will just have to wait and see
 The seller did offer to exchange the phone once they received the one being returned



needless to say I was a bit skeptical of this



I feel like the whole thing was a bait and switch
 Amazon has been very helpful in this matter



I shall wait for my refund





we will see

I clearly ordered this phone to use in the USA, and when I receive it, it renders useless because it does not function in the USI contacted the seller and advised them about the issue, they then state that I would not able be able to use the phone in the USATHERE CLEARLY SHOULD'VE BEEN A DESCRIPTION IN THE PRODUCT DETAIL STATING THAT THE PHONE CANNOT BE USED IN THE USIT WAS A WASTE OF TIME JUST WAITING FOR THE PHONE TO ARRIVE (OVER A MONTH)Very disappointed
Will not be buying from this seller in the future
super scam
This is a simple phone with a good signal
 You can move to any part of the home and always have network signal so recommend

it was said its unlocked phone, but now i see it locked
 doesnt work without any carrier except t mobile

Producto llegó en buenas condiciones y cumplió mis expectativas, recomiendo ampliamente a este proveedor espero poder realizar futuras compras y mantener la relación comercial
Nokia phones have always been good to me
 I bought this model through Amazon as it was less than half of what AT&T wanted for the same thing
 It's a simple phone that is easy to use for phone calls and texting


which is all I want in a phone

tis phone did not hve all my info on it from my sim card
 Also, i cant' get my pics and videos on this phone
 you can;t forward messages to more tan 1 person at a time

Simplicity at a great price
 Key pad is large
 Numbers easy to handle
 Superior sound
 A great basic phone at a fantastic price

Nokia 2720 S40 Unlocked Flip Phone with 1
3 MP Camera with Bluetooth--US Version with Full WarrantyNokia 2720 S40 Unlocked Flip Phone with 1
3 MP Camera with Bluetooth--US Version with Full Warranty
Having this phone for only a day leaves me with the impression that all I will be doing will be making phone calls with it
 What jumps out at me is the poor screen resolution and weak display
 The phone is replacing a Nokia 6133 that was used for calls, texts and an occasional game
 The 6133 had a solid display that was easily read for the occasional text message and navigating through the menus
 The 2720 screen is terrible, I can hardly make out anything that is on it and I dread the task of entering contact information
Since my needs are basic I think that the 2720 will be adequate but I will not be raving about how a good a phone it is
I will follow up with more if anything stands out after more use
There was no problem with entering contact information, worked out just fine

I bought this as a gift for my husband who has a sim card with a pay and go phone with another company
T Mobile wants me to use T Mobile I guess and his sim card won't work in this phone
 It reads the card but says no network service
Doesn't unlocked mean you can exchange sim cards back and forth
I am very disappointed

i got this phone today and it was locked 






 dont buy it and i want refund now 
































 thats it
I tried to order the correct phone twice and both times it came in with a TMobile connection
 There was a message that refused to be deleted
 The ad didn't say anything about this
 I am an ATT customer and the phone is advertised as being compatible

They say you get what you paid for and this phone is just that
 Unless I shouted, no one can hear me, maybe every other word that I said
 Save your money and buy something that works better

I am living overseas and have tried and spent money trying to unlock this phone, it did not unlock and now I am here without a phone

this was a replacement for my husbands 3 yr old Nokia
 He just uses it as a phone nothing else
 Cancelled his land phone
this is a good phone if that's all you want it for
 the only drawback for him is that he's a bit hard of hearing and the volume is at it's highest and he still thinks it's a bit too low
 other than that it works great with no problems whatsoever

DOES NOT WORK WITH AT&T
 I bought this phone as a replacement for my aunt
 She had this phone for about a year & broke after being accidently submerged in water
 After looking at other replacement phones, she said she really wanted one just like what she had
 If you buy from ATT it's about $200, so I found this one that claimed to worked with ATT
 Well it doesn't & I'm not happy
 RETURNING ASAP

The phone sets itself up nicely
 Voice mail seems to automatically set itself up, unlike the korean phones which leave the basic user with a 'voice mail has not been set up' message
I bought the phone for a housemate who wants a simple phone
 She cannot hear the ringer and misses calls
 This is a problem, it is too quiet

I bought this phone as a temporary phone to use until my contract was up and I could get a free phone
 First off the phone took 2 weeks to arrive and when it finally arrived I found out it was a refurbished phone (which was never mentioned)The box the phone came in was ripped up and contents were cheaply wrapped in plastic that is how I knew it was refurbished
 The phone itself sucks, it is very difficult to hear anyone or for anyone to hear me while speaking on it
 The cover on the back that goes over the battery is a thin flimsy piece of plastic which constantly falls off while in my pocketbook and the battery falls out
 The camera on it is horrible, I had less expensive phones that had much better picture quality then this phone
 Another thing is when you want to get back to main screen simply closing phone won't do it
 You have to push end several times to get back to main screen
 When I close phone after phone call it is still connected unless I press exit or end
 Same thing goes for texting it will leave you on text you wrote or recently read, simply closing phone won't bring you back to main menu
 When using the speaker phone option you can't initiate speaker until the other party answers which is very annoying
 I'm going to keep it as a desperation back-up phone, because it took so long to get to me I don't want the headache of sending it back

It said it was ATT 
 When we took it over to AT&T it said we could not use it because it could not be used with AT&T
 So we have phone that can't be used

Good phones for the price, was a great for the year I got it, I buy those for my parents and they like it

Good product, excelent
Very good
 thank you



ok
Excelente
Excelente



an essential item that work as intended and doesnt have much more to say about that
 would recommend to others

I really wanted this phone to work for me - It was identical to the phone it was to replace
 Unfortunately - with multiple calls to my phone provider and a new sim card - we were unable to get a signal
 My provider said the identification number labeled it a smart phone which it was not


I returned this item to the vendor

May 26, 2014
 Yesterday, seven days after the "Return Window", the battery of my'Nokia 2720 S40 Unlocked Flip Phone with 1
3 MP Camera with Bluetooth--US Version with Full Warranty" started failing
 First the charge would completely vanish after a call
 Then after rechargeing it, and being alerted by the phone itself that it had been recharged, the phone would not even turn on
 Dead
 Only a silence is heard from the seller Amazon Warehouse Deals, Inc

 And of course the words of its epitaph are "This item cannot be returned
 Return Window expired on May 18, 2014"

I am extremely please with my phone ,I haven't had anyproblems so far and the charge lasts a long time
I didn't find the phone expensive either

Does not work in Costa Rica, but still says it is unlocked, it's a trap, should change the title to the product name

I buy the Nokia cell phone to bring to use in Ecuador, but, when I turned on de phone the screen didn{t work
I live in Ecuador and I can't to return this item

its a very nice phone with a pretty nice camera
 for the people who are happy with just making calls and texting with few basic additional features this is what u are looking for

Hola estoy en Venezuela compre 2 de estos telefonos y no estan liberados, no los puedo usar con la operadora Digitel

This is a great low cost cell phone, and it is really easy to use, small and lightweight
You won't regret
Very Quality product
 There are no issue till now
 Very cheap with all the options
 very handy
 High quality sound and signal
 Excellent Product for the price spent

Just bought this mobile, where the product ad says


 unlocked


 but for my surprise, it cannot be used, once it is locked



As I bought as a gift which has now to pay to unlock the device
 shame

I got this phone as a replacement phone for my father
 He had been using a Motorola V195, but it suddenly stopped working after many years of faithful service
 I was looking for a simple, easy to use phone similar to the V195, because he's not tech savvy, and for him, the simpler, the better
 The Nokia 2720 S40 Flip fit the bill
 An added bonus is that the call quality is much clearer on the 2720
 It's a straightforward flip phone, with some nice features
 In fact, after setting up his phone, I liked it so much, I bought one for myself, to replace a Samsung flip phone
 But the 2720 I bought for myself came from WalMart, for $31/shipped site-to-store
 The phones are similar, but not identical
 I'll do my best to explain the differences below:To begin with, the Amazon 2720, even though it says "US Version with Full Warranty", does NOT come with a full US warranty from Nokia
 The good folks at UnlockedCellPhoneKings, who filled the Amazon order, explained to me that ALL UNLOCKED CELL PHONES void the manufacturer's warranty
 They also stated that Amazon writes the headings for the ad and they have no control over what Amazon writes
 In terms of the warranty that does come with the Amazon 2720 -- THEY (UnlockedCellPhoneKings) provide their OWN warranty (in this case, a 1 year warranty)
 And while that's better than nothing, it is not the true full US warranty that comes with the WalMart pre-paid Nokia 2720
 Furthermore, the WalMart prepaid 2720 comes in a sealed package, with the actual manual that's specific to the 2720
 The 2720 that I got from UCPK's came was in a generic box with a generic manual
 I called UCPK's to ask why, and they explained that they buy in bulk, then put together packages after they get an order
 They claimed that the phones are brand new, but there's really no way of knowing that
 I would suggest that if you buy one of these phones from Amazon, rather than from WalMart, you buy it from UnlockedCellPhoneKings -- they were a pleasure to deal with, and they have a toll free number
As far as the phone itself, I prefer the one from Amazon
 It has certain options (i
e
 it allows you to re-configure BOTH soft key pads, rather than just the left soft key pad), and the home page (the page you see when you first open the phone) has the time in a much bigger font than the WalMart 2720
 But that's basically aesthetics, and each person's preferences are going to be different
 In terms of actually using the phone, they're both easy to set up and easy to use
 (I had read that some people felt the volume was too low when using the speakerphone
 I think the reason is that the speakerphone does not use the same volume setting as the normal mode
 You have to press the up volume button while you're on the speakerphone in order to increase the volume to a more audible level
) The only real drawback I found is that these phones are fingerprint magnets
 I would suggest getting some inexpensive face plate covers (front and back), since they faceplates not only provide protection to the phone, but also they cut down considerably on the fingerprints
In terms of a simple, easy to use flip phone, the 2720 does a good job, and these types of basic phones are becoming harder and harder to find
 And while I like some of the features of the Amazon 2720 better than the WalMart 2720, for the price, I'd go with the WalMart 2720 for $31/shipped to the store
 The one inconvenience, as another reviewer pointed out, is the fact that there's no USB outlet or removable memory card on the 2720, so even though it takes photos, there's no simple, direct way to GET the photos from the phone to your computer
 There are two possible options
 1 is to get a USB Bluetooth dongle to plug into your computer
 You then pair the phone with the computer (but not as a modem) and you can transfer files from the phone to the computer, or vise versa, IF you have the right software
 (Nokia has 2 free software suites -- Nokia PC Suite (which is older), and Nokia OVI Suite
 Even though PC Suite is older, a lot of users seem to prefer it to the newer OVI Suite
 Both are available for free download on the Nokia site
)Another option is to get a USB SIM card reader
 They work like memory card readers, and range in price from around $8 to $30
 I read some reviews and the cheaper ones don't seem to work all that well
 The one that seemed to get the highest reviews was the: Dekart SIM Card Reader + SIM Manager 2 software
 Here's the Amazon link: http://www
amazon
com/Dekart-Card-Reader-Manager-software/dp/B0045BIUGG/ref=sr_1_5
ie=UTF8&qid=1296592924&sr=8-5
 It can also be purchased directly from the Dekart site: [


](Personally, I find the shipping costs to be ridiculous from both places, but I was unable to find this item from any other source other than Amazon or Dekart directly
)(NOTE: I have T-Mobile, and the SIM cards from the old phones worked perfectly in both the Amazon 2720 and the WalMart 2720
 I simply inserted the old SIM cards, synced them with the built-in phone address book memory, and was on my way
 The folks at UCPK's explained that the 2720's that they sell are designed to work fully with T-Mobile
 They will still work with AT&T, but not all of the options will be fully operational
 The ones from Walmart appear to be locked into T-Mobile, but I'm not 100% sure about that
)
I really like this mobile communication and continuous tube with these people 

 are very serious in his work 

 and will gladly buy back 



The phone is really good for the price with the features it has


I thought of buying couple more

but they were out of stock



Call quality is great for me and the person I'm calling
 Speakerphone quality is excellent
 Reception is great on T-Mobile
 Screen is small but gorgeous and the design is very sharp
 This phone does what I want it to do and looks great doing it
 Another thing to consider is that accessories (i
e
 extra charger, car charger, hands free, etc
) are very reasonably priced compared to some other brands
 I'll be heading to the UK soon and love that I'll be able to use this phone there as well
My previous phone was an iPhone
 It was great, but once the novelty wore off I found it was more than I really needed
 I don't care for all the bells & whistles
 I just want to make calls and send texts
 Maybe snap a picture or two
 This gets the job done fairly inexpensively
 Two thumbs up

Received phone within time period; works well with my bluetooth
 Only problem is the camera
 Images are not as clear as my other phone, but will suffice for my needs
 Easy to operate and would probably purchase again if necessary

First phone I ordered showed up DOA
 Although it did take a charge, it wouldn't turn on afterwards
 Replacement phone works great
 Quad band ensure's you can pretty much use it anywhere in the world
 Phone has about 5-6 days on standby with a full charge
 A good phone for travelling with
 Returning defective phone was a breeze with amazon
 I had my replacement before I could even get the defective phone to ups

This just goes to show that Europe gets better phones
 Any american phone for this quality would easily be over $150, and even then would most likely have some of these features cut

We recently purchased this phone for our son
 He has many hand held gadgets and just wanted a basic phone
 He likes the phone, however, it can neither send nor receive photos via text message
 He says the signal is fair but not great either
 He is happy with it and it serves as a great no fuss phone but for those 2 minor flaws
 It's a great price for a basic phone

a few months back i was finally able to get internet on my phone by following Opera mini's instructions on the "help" section of their website
 The phone works perfectly fine and the delivery was excellent :-)

Pros:* The phone has a clean and simple design
 The navigation menu isn't cluttered like most other phones these days
* The call quality is decent, and the screen is bright
* Bluetooth works as it should
CONS


 Here we go


* The battery life is sub-par
 An hour-long call is enough to bring the battery life down to half-charge
 One of the methods the manual offers to conserve battery life is to lower the brightness of the display
 The thing is, YOU CAN'T
 There is NO OPTION ANYWHERE in the display menu or any other area to control the brightness of the screen (and it is bright)
* There is no way to control the size and layout of the time and date on the main screen
 This is especially annoying when you want to gaze at the lovely wallpaper you install
 The only way around this is to hide the clock and the date completely
* The phone does not come with its own USB to connect to the PC
 This is important, because you (supposedly) NEED to update the software on this phone when you get it or you will run into problems like being unable to receive and send multimedia text messages
 The Nokia website states that you can update directly from the phone itself but only with some models
 Apparently, they decided not to have that convenience with the 2730, so the only way to update is through a PC connection
 Of course, you can't use just any usb connector
 I have no idea what this particular inlet model is called but I took a picture of it and will post it in the product photos
I currently am unable to send or receive multimedia messages and had to work it out with AT&T for quite a while to come up with a solution, which we didn't
 The multimedia messages menu won't even allow me to mess around with the Configuration Settings to configure my service provider
 My only option is to install the update and hope for the best but, of course, it didn't come with the USB
If it weren't for these issues, I would have given it four stars

I just returned from a trip to Asia, visiting 2 countries
 I did research to ensure this phone is supposed to have the bandwidth to support the wireless spectrums used by those 2 countries
 Since the phone was already unlocked, I simply purchased a SIM local to the country, pop the SIM in, and activated the SIM/phone #
 Wholla
 Works like a charm
 Called local to the country and back to USA
 Sound quality is crystal clear
 A friend could not even tell I was almost half way around the world when we chatted
The back case is a bit tough to open initially
 The back cover will only slide downwards for a few millimeters, where then you can lift the cover to access the battery and the SIM slot
 After the first couple of times, the stickiness wears off
You can then go to the Nokia website to download their Ovi Suite software, where you can transfer data between your phone and computer via USB cable
It would have been nice (would have been willing to pay a little more) for the vendor to have included the USB data/charger cable with the phone
 I had to locate and purchase it separately on a different website
The one weakness of the phone is that there is no quick way to change volume without taking the phone away from the ear

i had this phone from 2011 to 2012
it only lasted a year
 the screen would stop working after a few drops on the ground

Awesome
 Love it
 Had it in Ireland and have here in the USA
 Love it
 No complaints
 Decent battery life depends on usage of phone

Pros: Price ($90)
 Decent audio quality
 Good reception
 Bright, high resolution screen (small, however), the GPS map software actually works
 (But it needs extra hardware
 See below
 Voice recorder and camera are functional
 Does not come with the AT&T ringtone/startup sound
Cons: Battery life is short
 Does get quite warm
 Does not support large memory cards (I read 4GB max
 I'm using a 2GB card)
 It's not an iphone
 I would not dream of using this to browse the web or send email
 Calendar has a loud irritating alert sound
I've had it for 5 months
 It works perfectly for what I wanted
 It is incomparably better than the chintzy samsung freebie I had before
 As for the GPS, the maps are stored offline, so the GPS feature does not require an expensive data plan
 The OVI PC software you need to download the maps is actually not that bad
 You must have a 2GB memory card and a separate bluetooth GPS receiver, and a special cable to connect the PC to the phone USB CA101 Connectivity Cable
 For the GPS receiver, I'm using a Holux M-1000 32 Channel Wireless Bluetooth GPS Receiver, but any newer holux bluetooth GPS receiver would probably work too

good one , i already have this mobile - so i ordered one for my father 
 Sound is good and camera is not that much , only limited

liked the phone, but after a week or two the screen went crazy in the middle of a call and I could not see half the screen




returned it and got another one


 after a week I could barely hear sound out of the speaker




worked fine if I had my bluetooth on


so I sent this one back




third one would NOT recognize my SIM card - so I gave up

I bought the phone 4 months ago and it worked great until now
 It has all the functions I needed and then some
 The phone itself looks good, however it feels a little cheap with the plastic housing
 My wife has a similar Nokia phone, however her housing is made out of metal
 I didn't think much of it until now
 The phone slipped out of my hand and hit the ground from around 4 feet
 Not sure if it was an unlucky fall, but the screen broke on the inside
 You can't tell that it's broken, unless the backlighting is on
 The phone is completely useless to me
 The whole thing is really strange, given that, at one time or other, I've dropped all my cell phones
 The worst thing that has ever happened was the battery cover popping off
 I seems that with this phone, the screen is super sensitive
 If you buy this, I would highly recommend also buying some sort of padded case

While this is a fine phone, there is a serious error in the product description
 The phone does NOT have GPS as listed
 Straight from the product manual: "Your device does not have an internal GPS antenna
 To use applications that require a GPS connection, use a compatible external GPS receiver (accessory sold separately)
 Pair the GPS receiver with your device using Bluetooth wireless technology
" This is, obviously, useless
 [Update: Because of this, Amazon offered a 20% credit or returning the phone for a full refund
]Also, like other users have reported, we were unable to receive MMS messages, until updating the firmware to the latest version (v10
45)
 This was particularly problematic for us, as our service provider's welcome message was in MMS format
 However, to update the software you need to find and purchase a Nokia CA-101 data cable, which is not included (as others have stated) and download and install Nokia Ovi Suite (the Nokia Device Update or Nokia PC Suite software packages will not provide updates for this phone)
UPDATE:Upon our return to the U
S
 I contacted Amazon to discuss the incorrect product description re
 GPS
 We were offered the choice of a 20% credit and keeping the phone or returning the phone for a full refund
 That is good customer service
 I still wish the phone had GPS, but I'm upping the review to three stars

The alarm does not work
 The phone heats up so much after five minutes of conversation that it's hard to hold
 The sound quality is very low and there is no volume adjustment
 The battery started running out in two days with basically one hour talking time per day
 I'm not sure but maybe they sent me a refurbished phone
 If not, this is a very bad phone

I am very with this phone does everything I need from the moment it arrived started making phone calls and playing my music

My wife just need a basic, reliable phone
 Ordered it via Amazon
 It came with a household charger, headphone
 I order a silicon skin from Ebay for $2
00
 Nice phone
 My wife loves it

the product is excellent, it is released to all operators in Venezuela 


 and the design is simple and practicalI just have to say that memory came the cel is 1GB, the rest all right
thank u
excellent product
works well economical phone
The item arrived on time and excellent quality, fulfilled my expectations
love it no words for it
What i desired
I like this phone, simple easy and handy

I was traveling through Europe and needed a phone that will work in various countries, and this did the trick
 It worked in Spain, Germany, Hungary, Bosnia and Croatia
 I didn't use any of the functions other than calling and texting so I cannot comment on those, but the phone is nice, lightweight, looks good and it worked

If youre looking for a solid cell phone from Nokia this is a great choice
 But the volume is so low its hard to hear

This is the third 2760 I've had, and in between I got a Blackberry which wasn't worth the work and the learning curve to have a few more conveniences
 I went back to this model because it works
 It is simple
 It is reliable and has just enough functions to serve me, a senior citizen, just fine

quality is totally not what i was expecting
 callers sounded like they were underwater across the globe
 would never order again



When I bought the phones, they sent me locked and I asked unlocked
 It is big deal, because I living in centralamerica

No funciona en Costa Rica, el numero de IMEI no es valido en Costa Rica a pesar de que las caracteristicas dicen que esta desbloqueado, no lo compren es dinero perdido

I paid for an unlocked phone but received a locked phone
 After a lot of hassle, these guys replaced with one Motorola for some extra charges and shipping cost
 This phone did not even switch on
 Now the warranty period is over as the company rep says and they can do nothing about this cell phone
Never will buy phone from Amazon
com 
 Motorola is six sigma company but Amazon's suppliers are selling defective phones pretending as new phones
 Good luck if you still buy

This was an excellent product
 Although it's an old series, the phone is reliable and durable
 I dropped it countless times and it still works even in water once
 I highly recommend this product

My husband tells me it's a fine Nokia cell phone, but because he's Italian and uses it primarily in Italy, he finds some difficulty with no italian language selection

I rated only 4 stars because it's camera and loud speaker needs to be corrected/reformed
It is good but not the best product
I recommend to get to those who want to use basic phones

Overall it is very good phone and most of it's good comes from absense of touch technology which is sux
UI response is very fast, you don't have to wait while media player is opening or smth else
I don't use mobile internet (never used) so I know nothing about how it works with this phone
Body is very good made - no gaps or smth like this
It is heavier then it looks but it's advantage for me
I managed to connect it to Nokia PC Suite (not Nokia Suite) to copy new music, but I found thatjust copying mp3 with tags to corresponding folders on Micro SD card is faster and easier
I use free mp3tag app to set tags to multiple mp3 files at once
Media player supports playlists, albums, artists, genres
Photo size is 1536x2048
Pros:Fast, non-touch, very good look and feel
Missed, received and dialed numbers are in one list which shows up when you press Send button
Music sound (with good earphones) is very, very good - it is louder than on my previousNokia 5800XM which is music-oriented, so to speak
Supports A2DP bluetooth profile, so I use it in the car w/o problems so far
Photo camera is very good too - self portrate, panorama, smth else which I'm not going to use
Simple photo editor
Photo gallery supports timeline mode - see photos specific to this date, press right and left to go to next/prev date
Video recording
Simulated calls - if you really need it
Feature to record current call
Can customize any function to right/left or 4 middle buttons
Can customize where to display contacts from - SIM, phone or both
Timed profiles (but Flight profile cannot be timed)
Cons:Ringer is not so loud as it could be - can miss a call in noisy environment
Vibro is not very strong
Battery lasts for ~4 days (with very moderate usage of music player) which is not as much as I expected
No way to remove not needed apps and games like Facebook, Twitter etc
When turned on 1st time it tries to send some text message to Nokia -I've text messages blocked so I got notification about unsuccessfull attempt to send it
Screen is very scratchable, buy a screen protector
Wish it have a flashlight))
Advice: turn of 3G in menu if you are not using Internet - battery should last longer

I love my basic phone, nothing like a simple phone used to make calls and text
 Battery life is amazing compared to my smartphone and I'm saving a ton of money each month by getting rid of the smartphone

I would have been happier if this phone was a dual SIM model as, is available and advertised for 301
2 unlocked quad-band world phones
 A USB cable would also have enhanced the rating
 I am otherwise satisfied and happy with the phone
 It is lovely to find an "old school" phone that features such a high standard of functionality and quality

It was a great phone while it lasted
 The phone worked well, it was very high quality for a feature phone, and had plenty of apps that made it border on the realm of a semi-smart phone
However, five days into using it, I was notified that there was a system software update
 It warned about using a high amount of bandwidth (1MB update), and recommended that the battery was over halfway charged
 I made sure everything was fine and good to go
 After the phone rebooted, a progressbar came on, finished, and then NOTHING
 The phone doesn't turn on anymore, it gets recognized by my computers for about three seconds before it can't be detected (in a ROM mode no less), and even when it gets detected, all of Nokia's recovery programs fail to work
Overall it was a great phone for five days
 I would have loved it had the thing been able to update properly
 One more thing: You can't even update it via USB, the only way to update the phone is OTA (Over The Air)
 That seems like a serious issue

I downgraded because the smart phone is such a hog of time
 This fits the bill, works well so far in the US with T-mobile, and looks slick
 The menus and organization is all over the place, probably because I'm used to smart phone, so it takes some familiarizing
 But I no longer check mail, find direction, check traffic, etc
 while driving, so peaceful

I really love this phone
 It's got better reception than my iPhone 4, and sounds better as well
 Way less dropped calls
 I travel a lot, and gauged that over the span of a 240 mile round trip I used to get cut off at about 12 different spots with my iPhone 4, whereas this phone only drops calls at 2 spots, and that's occasionally
 More often the call just gets distorted until I pick up a new tower
The interface is nothing to get excited about, but the small form factor is great
 Very light, yet durable
 I fits in the coin pocket of my favorite jeans
 The ability to access the micro SD without opening the phone is nice
I recently bought a Samsung Rugged II to replace this while I duke it out with AT&T whether this phone is "smart" of not, and feel like I am poised to lose the battle
 I will be sad if so, because the Samsung can't hold a candle to this
AT&T is telling me their network identifies my phone as an Acer Laptop, and there is nothing they can do about it, since it is not one of their phones
UPDATE: A rep at the AT&T store input some generic code to tell the system it's a basic phone
 All is well now

I had to replace my 10 year old Nokia flip phone
 I love Nokia and this little phone is perfect
 It is not a smartphone, but I did not want to have to pay hefty monthly fees for a smartphone
 Connection to the internet on At&T's Pay as you Go plan would require a $60 a month data plan
 With this phone, I pay $25 every three months and I can access the internet as well
 Since I don't use it often, it's just perfect for me

Came from an iPhone 5 to this phone in a long story
 Like this little thing a lot
 I'm not glued to it like an iPhone but if I get really bored and can still get on Facebook and Twitter
 Once you get all your shortcuts set up the phone is golden
 Even dropped it just today


 :) in Nokia fashion is survived and the asphalt was destroyed
 Not a statch


 Love it

The phone itself is nicely designed and offers pretty much exactly what you'd expect in terms of calls, texts, camera, etc
 My major complaint is what appears to be a hardware issue with the phone that I've read about in other venues since experiencing it: the screen intermittently goes completely white and the phone will not respond to anything
 Most of the time removing the battery solves the problem, but sometimes it doesn't and I just have to wait it out
 It happens at least once a day

Great basic little phone

Amazing phone


 Back to the basics for me
 I'm getting 4+ days battery life on T-mobile

nice
Great battery life, fine call quality, annoying screen resolution and OS
 Product was in perfect, absolutely new condition, exactly as described by the seller, I'm just not a fan of the usability of this OS compared to other feature phones I've had

Good product
 Light weight and handy

Good product
 Light weight and convenient

Excellent phone
 Arrived as advertised
 A bit pricey for "just a phone" - but some people don't do well with Smartphones, and this is a genuine Nokia, solid as a tank and very familiar interface

easy to use and kind of pretty (for the price)my mom is really happy
This is really a amazing simple 3
5G phone
 It's great because I got this for my Grandma and she finds it really simple to use
 The screen is nice and the buttons are easy to press
 The build quality is just amazing, it feels solid like a brick except that it's easy light and nice to hold, it feels great in your hands
 This is a semi smart phone because it has certain social networking apps so it can be useful for people who are new to the smartphone business or are light users
 Also it does not have wifi so you need a data connection to enjoy all the convenience of internet enables applications
 The call quality is great, at least for me but my grandma found it weird, but that may just be her
 The OS is again really simple so it's great for all users and the physical build quality is also very good
 I would recommend this to everyone looking for a simple but great phone

Good luck
very nice to use a wonderful semi-smart phone
very good phone, old fashion
Excelente producto

Originally bought 1/28/2014
 Amazon changed the date of my review when I updated/edited a few things in 2015
 I made a second edit 8/28/2016
 See end of review for this update
I have been searching for a feature phone since my trusty Sony 580 died over a year ago
 I neither have, nor want, a data plan
 I don't use internet on my phone
 I was happy to find that Nokia was still developing for this market with something more than your bottom-of-the-barrel Go-Phone, which is what I had been using since the demise of my Sony
I have had the phone about a year
 I don't love it like I did my Sony, even though it has some features that are better than the Sony, like standard jacks
 Here are my opinions/experiences with this phone:  Pros:        1
)  It works as a phone - I can hear my callers and they can hear me
 When set on full volume, calls through the handset are uncomfortably loud
 (Not so much through the speakerphone - see Cons, below
) Clarity could be better - the sound IS NOT comparable to a land line phone - but voices are less muffled than on the cheap Go-phones with which we've been making-do
 I've never had a smart phone, so can't compare the sound quality to a high-end phone
2
)  It has 10 alarms that can be set for any day of the week or one time only, with a snooze function that is variable between 2 & 59 minutes
 You can choose your alarm tone
3
) The calendar has multiple choices of reminders, including birthday and anniversary that calculate age and are set for the life of the phone
 You can also set these reminders through the directory
4
) The calculator has the normal calculator functions, but can also be used as a scientific or a loan calculator
 It also has these common choices: 1/x; %; square root; x squared; MS (memory store); MR (memory recall); C (clear); and plus-minus
5
)  Notes and To-do lists
 As a trial, I put in 21 To-Dos and 30 Notes
 30 is the limit for notes
 Probably the same for To-Dos
6
) Speakerphone/loudspeaker for calls and music  7
) Stopwatch8
) Countdown timer with alarm9
)  You can set it to 3G, GSM or dual mode
 Better battery life with GSM
10
)  Flight Mode
 Easily accessible
11
)  You can add units to the conversion calculator
 This is particularly useful since this phone was not developed for the US and many US equivalents were not included
 For instance, there is a conversion for Acres to Square Kilometers but not to Square Miles
 The is even a folder for "Lifestyle" conversions to add equivalents not found elsewhere
 I added Miles per Hour vs
 Kilometers per Hour, as there is no velocity converter
 All converters are backwards compatible
12
)  Unit lights up briefly to alert you when fully charged, but does not play a tone
 This is infinitely better than my Go-Phone that would awaken me when I was charging the battery overnight
13
)  You can opt out of emergency alerts
 My Go-Phone had no such option
 Amber/Silver alerts are important, but not in the middle of the night or when I get an alert from 300 miles away
 I can opt in again if weather alerts are likely
14
)  You can set an access code separate from a pin code to control access to certain operations like the browser,  app purchases and downloads
15
)  You can set a time limit on your phone Profile (normal, silent, meeting, etc
) so you don't have to worry about forgetting to reset your phone after you've been to the movies, etc
16
)  I had no trouble with MMS messaging
 I didn't have to do anything to set this up with ATT
 It worked right out of the box
 Unlike some other  reviewers, my phone is recognized as a "dumb phone" by ATT
 17
)  Has a radio and a music player
 I have some issues with ringer & speakerphone volume, but not with radio & music volume
 I often listen to podcasts & I can hear the spoken word clearly without earbuds
 Radio only works with earbuds, as earbuds function as antenna
 You can set it to play through the earbuds or through the speakerphone speaker
 3
5mm standard earbud jack
(Update: got a tablet that is much more convenient for podcasts
 Still use the phone as a radio and love this function
)18
) Standard micro USB charging jack
 Infinitely preferable to proprietary jacks
19
) Programable left and right selection keys
 I programed my left key for a list of shortcuts to tools/apps that I either use infrequently or are difficult to remember how to access
  My right key is programed to take me to my address book
20
) Programable soft keys
 A straight press of the central Navigation key takes you to the Menu screen
 Pressing the sides of the Navigation key up, down, left or right functions as soft keys
 You can program these soft keys with frequently used shortcuts, like Create a Message, or to take you to the Calendar or Calculator
21
) You can designate one person as your most frequent text recipient
 Very convenient
22
)  The home screen is divided into four four separate sections for very frequently used items
 The top section is slightly bigger than the others
 You can choose from 10 items or you have the option to leave a section blank
 Choices are: Calendar, Clock, Countdown Timer, General Indicators (I have no idea what this is
 When chosen, it simply reads "empty
"), Mail for Exchange, Mail, Notifications, Radio & Media, Shortcut Bar, SocialAccount or (empty)
  I use the first section to display the time
 On the next, I display the date, which also shows the next calendar entry, if there is one
 My third section choice is Shortcut Bar, from which I can choose from 53 different shortcuts
 Obviously, these shortcut choices are expanded from the original 10 choices given above
 (This Shortcuts BAR is also different from the Shortcuts LIST I set up as accessible through my left selection key
) Some of the expanded choices: alarms, camera, calculator, etc
 I currently have 15 items on this shortcut bar
 I don't know if there is a limit or if you can choose all 53 shortcuts
  My fourth section is the countdown timer
 I don't really use it all that often, but learned that this is the only way to easily display how much time is left on the timer when I do need a timer
Cons:1
)  There is no Tools file, but there are TWO Apps files
Apps file contains:  GamesAlarm clockCalculatorFilesVoice recorderTo-do ListNotesCountdown timerStopwatchAlso, within the Apps file is a folder called My Apps which contains: eBuddy (a now defunct chat app that eats up 615 kb)FacebookGoal (a soccer app, for pete's sake, that eats up 231 kb
)Mail for ExchangeNews and OffersNokia NearbyNotificationsSocialAccounts (to manage social networking)Store (Nokia app store to buy apps)The Weather ChannelTuneWikiTwitterWhatsAppand World Clock
 In addition, there is ANOTHER icon on the Menu Page called More Apps, to store all the apps you buy or download
 Can we perhaps have just ONE apps file for ALL the apps and a separate Tools file
 Oh, and Calendar is a file by itself on the Menu Page
 Might have been a good place for TOOLS
 (Just saying


)2
) I cannot delete any of the pre-loaded apps from the phone
 I equate this to bloatware
 I am perfectly capable of choosing my own apps, thank you
3
) In order to delete any of the pre-loaded apps, (Facebook, WhatsApp, Mail for Exchange), from the shortcuts list, (the one I access from my left selection key), you have to go to Options, Select Options, open Applications List, then unmark the pre-loaded apps, then press Done
 Took me a week of playing around to figure this out
 Most of the other tools you might want on a shortcut are simply listed under Options
 4
)  There are four apps, (Store, Facebook, WhatsApp & Mail for Exchange), that you cannot delete from the Shortcut Bar
 I NEVER use these apps, so find it irritating that I can't delete them
 At least I can arrange the bar so that my frequently used shortcuts are listed first
5
)  Phone is very slick, especially the face
 The keys are slightly convex
 This combines into a less than stellar texting experience as my fingers frequently slide off
  And I feel the need to grip the phone tightly so I don't drop it
 Getting a case helped
6
) If you want to add a new contact, you can only add their number and first and last name from the add contact screen
 In order to add other information, you have to edit a contact
 In order to edit a contact, you have to go to Names, then Select that Name (which feels like you would then call that person, but you don't) which takes you to a list of options, none of which is Edit
 You then have to choose the left selection key labeled Options, then Add detail, where you can add numbers, add internet (web and email addresses), add multimedia (specify a ringtone or add an image, or add personal info (street address, birthday, note, formal name, nickname, company, & job title)
 In my Sony phone, you just had to highlight a contact name and hit edit which took you to a scroll down menu where you could edit/input info
 7
) You can't block calls from specific numbers, although you can block all calls
 8
) Menus, folders and files are not intuitive
 You can probably finally find what you want if you are willing to devote a lot of time to playing with the programming, but this might be frustrating for users who are not comfortable with technology
 9
) Useless low battery notification
 Mine notified me, (and I am being generous), maybe 3 sec before it died
 Not enough time even to say "I think my phone is going to die" before it croaked
 Sometimes, I swear, there is no notification at all
 On my old phone I had at least 30 seconds, if not longer
 Usually enough time to plug in before it died
10
) Really low ringtones and alarms/alerts
 I've only downloaded one new ringtone, (brand-new, not copied from the Sony data card), but it isn't any louder than the ones already on the phone
 I have everything set as loud as it will go, but ringtones are still almost mute
 But at least I can hear callers
 Speakerphone also low volume
 Almost, but not quite, useless
 Oddly enough, the standard tone for calendar alerts is reasonably loud
 Unfortunately, you can't choose this tone for other things
 I also tried recording loud tones through the Voice Recorder
 Still comes out almost too low to hear
 I wear the phone against my body and almost always feel or hear the vibration of a current call, so I can deal with this irritation
 Oh, and turning off your phone or putting it on Silent does not turn off alerts
 I have not yet found where you can choose to mute alarms for a period of time, like when in a theatre
 I am going to be in trouble when I am someplace quiet and a calendar alarm goes off
  11
) Battery life nowhere close to what was advertised
 I usually read/write 2-3 texts per day, have 3 daily alarms, occasional calendar reminders and talk anywhere from 1 to 3 hours per day
  My battery is then almost fully depleted
 I MUST charge every night
 As a test, I talked for an hour on a fully charged phone
 When done, I was down one of the four bars indicating battery life
 It took 54 minutes to re-charge the battery to full
 I had hoped to be able to talk about 6 hours and still use all the other functions as needed
 Not possible
 If I have a heavy texting day, the battery life plummets
 Texting just eats the battery up
 Invest in a car charger - you'll need it
 However, if you don't use the phone, you could probably get 5 - 7 days between charges
 I have recently ordered a new OEM battery
 If my experience varies from the past, I will update this review
 (Update: new battery made no difference in battery usage
 Texting still eats up the battery and I still charge every night
)12
) Phone resets itself to its default ringtone even though I copied tones from my Sony and set them as ringers for specific callers
 New ringtones are on my data card, and the phone recognizes them, but I would have to reprogram the phone every day or two to have vanity ringtones
 Life is too short
 I gave it up and just use the default
 13
) There  is no way to turn predictive text on or off forever
 You change capitalization by clicking "#" but if you click it too fast, you turn on/off predictive text
 Also, no choice for numeric only
 You choices are: "ABC, Abc or abc
" if you want to use numbers in your texts, you must press and hold the key several seconds until the number pops up
 14
)  Loses texts
 The texting feature includes being able to read whole conversations, however, don't expect it to sort your responses correctly
 I often find texts from different people in the wrong conversational folder
 Also, it randomly loses texts entirely
 I recently (11/19/14) tried to look up a text that I specifically remember getting approximately 9/23/14
 I looked through ALL my folders and this text is just gone
 15
) Several times now, the phone has "frozen" and begun vibrating and buzzing loudly
 Then no buttons work
 It has done this most frequently while listening to saved music files for a long period of time
 For instance, I downloaded some white fan noise to help me sleep when traveling
 The phone froze and buzzed several nights in a row while I slept, waking me from a sound sleep like a fire alarm
 The only way to stop it is to pry off the back and remove the battery - not something easily accomplished when you've just awakened in a panic
 I finally decided to leave the back cover off and just use the rubber case to protect the phone
 Final Analysis: if I knew then what I know now, I don't know if I would still buy this phone
 Most of the Cons are just minor annoyances but the freezing thing is pretty serious
 Makes me question the longevity of the phone
 Compared to smart phones, this phone is pretty cheap at about $85 out-of-pocket, but since I am one frugal mama, that is still expensive to me, especially if it is going to crap out after only a year or two
 I might have been better off with an older high-end feature phone - one developed before smart phones took over the market
 I seriously doubt this was engineered as well as Nokia feature phones were in the past
Update 8/28/2016: Well, I guess I have an answer to whether or not I would choose this phone again - I would
 Or at least I would if it hadn't doubled in price since I bought it
 I don't know how a discontinued "dumb" phone goes from $89 in 2014 to $199 in 2016
 That is just insane
 It isn't that great a phone
 I liked a lot of the features, like having 10 alarms, and having birthday reminders in my calendar that also told me how old the person was, but not enough to pony up $200
I am a creature of habit, but I'm also a cheap SOB
 When the Nokia literally took a nap with the fishes, I looked around for a new phone and ultimately decided I would buy another 301 - until I saw how outrageously they are now priced
 Unfortunately, I also discovered in my research that there are 3 versions of this phone, only one of which will continue working in the USA after Dec, and only Amazon is selling that version
 (Model RM-841
 This info can be found on the white label under the battery
) Rather than pay the new extortion price, I hopped over to Kroger and bought a $20 Go Phone
 Do I like it
 No
 It irritates the living daylights out of me
 But when I think about it costing only $20 - I get a whole lot happier
One last Con I discovered since I had to get a new phone: you can port a phone's worth of contacts TO the 301, but woe unto you if you need to port your contacts from the 301 to another phone
 The Go Phone necessitated a new micro sim card
 AT&T couldn't read my old mini sim, even though I could still access it thru the 301
 (Water damaged the in & out mics, but the rest of the phone works
) I had to bluetooth/slam each contact to the new phone individually: a process that took me over 4 hours
Update 9/14/2016: It took 2 weeks in industrial strength dessicant, but the 301 has been resurrected
 All functions appear to have returned to normal
 After a few weeks with the horrible Go-phone, I have upped my review to 4 stars
 I know this phone won't last forever
 I just ordered some cheap rubber port covers to try to avoid the humidity issues that almost trashed it this summer
 I know I will be forced into a smart phone sooner rather than later, but I found I definitely like this phone better than anything else I can afford right now
 (But it is still horribly overpriced at $200
)
I've had this phone for almost 2 months
 I loved it when I got it and I love it just as much today
 Nokia is so great when it comes to giving their customers what they really want
 Every time my friends can't get through to make a call with their smart phones, it's my Nokia they want to borrow
 LOVE THIS PHONE
 Tough, Dependable, Handsome, Very Clear Reception
 Good Price too

Have just started using it, but all seems to be well
 Stylish and compact

all was as advertised
 volume is very good for inexpensive unit
Its a pretty good phone for what it is
 I gave it 4 stars because of the high price I paid
 I bought this phone for my mother that doesn't have a data plan but needed a new phone that was reliable and had long battery life and didn't require a data plan
 It was a HUGE update over her old LG flip phone with less than 1 megapixel camera (LOL)
 The 3 megapixel camera is actually pretty decent, no auto focus of course

but it gets the job done and the images are pretty usable in good light
 Nothing like a smartphone today though
 This phone is really easy to read, has good bright screen that seems to be scratch resistant so far
 Has a 3
5mm headphone jack for listening to music with normal headphones and in fact, it even comes with a pair of earbuds
 My mom keeps them in her purse and listens to the radio sometimes at work
The call quality was VERY important and this exceeds my expectations
 The HD voice this supposedly has, really works
 I can finally call my mom or vice versa and actually understand what she is saying now
 Before it was so muted and broken up
The build quality is pretty good I must say, doesn't seem liked it would break if dropped
 The buttons feel good, the backlit keyboard is a nice touch
 Overall, the phone has really good looks and doesn't look like your typical basic phone
It comes with some okay apps, but most of them are only useful if you have a data plan
 There are some apps available online that you can download and install on the phone

just basic free games
My mom really wanted to get a smartphone

but the costs of adding another data plan to the line was just outrageous
 She is using AT&T, I would really love to switch to T-Mobile, but they just don't have that great of a service here in Vermont
 Maybe someday
 I contacted AT&T about this phone and they said this phone DOES NOT require a data plan
 I originally wanted to get her the Nokia Asha 501 because it has Wifi and a touch screen

but AT&T told me that its considered a smartphone BECAUSE it has Wifi and a touch screen
So this phone was a compromise and so far, she likes it
 The battery life is just incredible

stays charged well over a week
 Her old phone, she had to change probably 3 times a day
Despite the cost of this phone, it was a pretty good buy
 Hopefully someday I can get my mom on the smartphone bandwagon

I really love it, the product is excellent
Felt pretty solid for a plastic phone too
 Volume wasn't good, must be set for battery conservation
 Set on high the rings were pathetic
 Alarms were worse, plus that volume dropped significantly after half a second
 Tried with the factory alarms, mp3s, Nokia ADTS (aac) on phone and card memory

Popped in SIM card and it started working immediately
 Next test will be Australia
 So far it's been a great, easy to use phone

i waited a long time to find one of these ,,now i'm wrapt that i found one ,, its great 


only 60 day warranty
 This phone stopped receiving signal
 Took it to AT&T and they tried exchanging the SIM card
 Still doesn't get signal
 Looks like the antenna is broken
 Only had this phone about 4 1/2 months with gentle usage
 Worst purchase from Amazon ever
 Worst return and warranty policies
 Won't buy a phone off of here again

This phone has 3g and basic email setup
 It will work with ATT (including 3g and mms)
Best part is you can take it to anywhere in the world and it will work fine
 Especially INDIA
Battery life is excellent
 It has facebook, whatsapp etc
 I have an Iphone 5 and the main reason for getting this phone was for international travel and battery life (backup phone)Also this is not the dual sim phone version
 But it has a micro SD card reader
Comes with US charger, a basic headphone with mic and all the manuals

I just use this as an awesome pay-as-you-go "Voice Phone" to supplement my work-supplied smartphone with unlimited voice/internet
 I just wanted something small and easy to slip in my pocket, because my old E51 can only hold about an hour charge after 5+ years
 For voice calls, it's great
 And the ringer gets CRAZY Loud
 I do miss ability to connect via wi-fi (because I've never tried any of the internet features)


 but I'm too cheap to burn my pay-as-you-go minutes for internet
 With internet/Bluetooth disabled, and only voice/text enabled the phone seems to hold a charge for about 24 days


 and I've talked as long as 11 hours on it before the bar got down to 1/3 to 1/4th power
 My phone generally just sits in a low-power sleep mode awaiting calls, so that might explain my highend battery life
 It beats the pants off of the "Disposable" TracPhones


 and my HTC Sensation/Blackberry/Samsug Galaxy S for voice calls and ring volume
 I can hear it from the other side of the house (Though I did set the electronic screeching of Skrillex "Boomerang" as my ring tone so it would be extremely audible
) Decent MP3 Player too
 Camera is small in MegaPixel but the seamless Panoramic Patch-View mode that stitches together pictures by connecting invisible "floating boxes" works really well
 Wish my high-end Digital Cameras did that
 I should also mention that I dropped my contracts with T-Mobile, and switched to pay-as-you-go
 I was really hesitant to do this, but on paper it saved $1000/year for my wife and I
 Now, we load about 1000 minutes every 6 months @ 100 dollars for 10 cents a minute and a 1 year expiration
 Since these are our "backup phones" for inbound calls and we my work phone with unlimited minutes


 this works perfectly
 I couldn't ask for a better Voice Phone with a simple keypad, Camera and MP3 player
 I picked this over the E52 largely because this is a new phone, and that is technology from 3 years ago which I'd have to buy from the Gray Market overseas
 I didn't figured that battery life on any new "Prior Generation Phones" (like the E51 or E52) would be dubious at best -- since and the battery would have been resting in a "New Unopened" box for so many years in a discharged state
 I'm on the Internet enough at work


 and I have my Work Phone for that
 As a great Voice/Text phone, the sound, volume and quality is perfect

I love this phone
 My previous phone was Nokia 5310 and I got this one as an upgrade recently because the buttons had cracked on my old phone
 I like that this is a simple phone (not a "smart" phone, has no touch screen, menus are easy to navigate) but has all the features I need in a phone
 The battery life is pretty good
 I don't make many calls or send many texts and I get about 3 days of battery life before I need to recharge it
 It was very easy for me to set this up with my contacts and plug into my (Windows) computer to install custom wallpapers and (MP3) ringtones
 The camera is decent, seems to take better photos than my old phone did and the camera has more settings than the camera on the 5310 did
 I have T-Mobile service and it was very easy to simply switch my SIM card to this phone from my old one
 The USB cable (Nokia model CA-101) from my old phone worked perfectly with this one to connect it to my computer and drag/drop files and photos onto this phone
 The Nokia 301 did not come with a USB cable
 This phone has the ability to check emails and such but I never use that feature (I don't have the upgraded phone service) so I can't comment on how quickly it allows you to accomplish those tasks
 My only real complaint about this phone is that it does not have full-screen photocall (like my old Nokia phone did) and it doesn't let me view photos as organized by folder from the mini SD card (just views them as if they were all in one huge folder unless you specifically save them to individual "albums" and then only view the album that contains the photo you want to view)
 Other than that, it's a great, simple mobile phone for those that are not really very tech-savvy
 It seems to be made well and I'm confident that it will last longer than my old phone did
 It is slightly larger than the Nokia 5310 and the buttons are bigger and more sturdy so they won't crack from texting a lot (like the 5310's buttons)
 I easily found a nice protective gel cover and clear screen protector film/cover for it on eBay
edit Oct 2015: I still love this phone
 I've had it a while and still holding up great
 None of the buttons got cracked at all even though I text often
 I'm still getting about three days of battery life on it (the original battery) before it needs charging but I rarely makes any calls (only daily texting)
 The gel cover (bought from "cbcelectronic" on eBay held up great and easily protected the phone from the many times I've dropped it and the screen is still like brand new as well because of the protective film
 I bought my Nokia 301 from the seller "Zezoo Store" on Amazon and it came brand new in original Nokia box
edit 2: I bought "MaGeek® 6ft micro USB to USB Cable High Speed USB 2
0 A Male to Micro B" for this phone and it is very nice quality cord that worked perfectly with this model of phone so I could transfer MP3s and photos and such between the phone and my Windows 7 computer
The phone is still holding up beautifully and I text often
 I wish they still made this model phone, as I'd readily buy another if/when it ever breaks
 I'm not a fan of "smart" phones or phones with touch screen
 My phone still has the original battery though it doesn't keep the charge as long as it used to when I first got it and I charge it about every 2 days now

Thought this might be a good basic phone, but it definitely has its shortcomings
 The construction is good, but I got a better signal on my 6-year-old Nokia 5310, and it couldn't read the music and photos on my SIM card, only the address book
 Wish I could have liked it more

First off, this is a great phone for someone who wants a simple,durable, and reliable phone
The Good:+Works with AT&T 3G and works as a VERY fast modem when you connect it to your computer
 Also works with T-Mobile, but you may not get 3G in your area, but you will get EDGE at the very least, which is more than enough when using the phone's built in browser
+Speaker is fairly loud and better than other basic Nokia's
+Camera is good and fast for a 3
2MP, also has extra features like panoramic and self-portrait
+Battery life is GREAT
 Will last 4 days easily with moderate to heavy use and probably a week or more with light use
+Build Quality
 This thing is built like a tank and the keyboard feels great
 This thing will outlast any drop, maybe even a bullet


But there are a few minor issues
The Bad:-There is no volume rocker
 You use the D-Pad when in a call, but you cannot adjust the volume when in any application
 Like web browsing or reading text messages
-No multi-tasking
 Not a big deal, but if you are in the browser or using an application like Google Maps, you cannot activate the loudspeaker unless you exit the application while still in the phone call
 Also you must exit any application/game to read a text message and reload the application/game again
Other Small Issues:=Camera has no autofocus or flashlight
=No Wi-Fi
 Not a big deal, especially if you have 3G service in your area
=Limited tethering capabilities
 You can tether to an Android device and use it as a portable modem using BlueVPN, but you will have limited capabilities
Overall, this is an amazing phone if you want a simple, elegant and durable phone
 The features are better than other basic phones and this phone is very fast
 Another Nokia phone to consider is the Nokia C2-01
 It has the same camera, but it has a smaller screen and the 3G is not as fast
 The C2-01 is a better option for those who like to tether their phone to iPods and Andoids and also for those who like to hack into their phone to customize it and add multi-tasking
5 Stars for the Nokia 301, it is truely a great phone
Edit: After using the phone with WhatsApp, it IS possible to use WhatsApp on this phone and it works quite well
 The issue is that once you start using it, the battery life drops dramatically
 You can get about 1 day of battery life, less than what I get on my smartphone
 This is quite disappointing
Some other minor issues is that although it is a GSM phone and has 3
5G
 it is only on 850/1900
 Which is fine is America, but they removed the 2100Mhz from upgrading from the C2-01
 I would recommend a C2-01 over this phone as it is a better all around phone, but slower 3G speeds
I have reduced my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars
 The fact that Nokia (or Microsoft
) has removed features from "upgrading" is a shame
 It is still a good phone, but there are betters out there
 And Nokia, PUT IN A VOLUME ROCKER


For what I need, is a very good phone
 The battery last around a week, with a 3-4 hours talking, around 15 text messages, alarm clock every day
 It feels good in hand (pretty heavy, not cheap, even though is a cheap plastic)
I don't listen music, I don't play games, I don't surf the net with the phone
 I just needed a phone that makes phone calls, has a good sound, good volume, can receive and send text messages
 This is all I need from a phone
 For the rest I have tablet and computer
What I don't like is that missing calls and messages reminder is not a feature of this phone

I'm going to try to post the same review for two different Nokia "feature" phones, both of which I've bought through Amazon
 First some context: I'm a geezer who likes dumb phones
 I want a phone that will allow me to make and receive voice calls, and send and receive occasional text messages
 That's it
 No social networking, no automatic touch-and-pay capability, no spoken driving directions, etc
 My previous phone, which I owned for about 8 years, was a Nokia 6030
 Great phone
Recent phone calls and mailings from carrier AT&T warned me that my "phone will no longer be supported" after 11/30/14 in my service area in NorCal
 I have a little technical background, but am not a phone geek
 Had to do a bit of research on phone bandwidths, frequencies, and "generations"
 I wanted to understand why my old phone had finally reached end-of-life, and to pick a replacement that would provide similar capabilities and a long-as-possible future life
 Hopefully this research will be helpful to others who face the same situation down the road
My old 6030 was a "GSM-only" phone
 I had found on trips to Europe that it's also a U
S
-only phone
 GSM is sometimes referred to as "2G", and it's this 2G function that AT&T is in the process of dismantling across the U
S
, ending with final shutdown by 12/16
 So I was looking for a 3G or better replacement phone
Both 2G and 3G generations of phones use different wireless frequencies in the U
S
 (and Latin America) vs
 the rest of the world (ROW)
 U
S
 3G runs 850 & 1900 MHz, with the lower "more flexible" frequency working better on insides of buildings
 ROW 3G runs 900 & 2100 MHz
I initially chose the Nokia C2-01
5 for its small size (2-in
 display), closest to my old 6030, and fitting nicely in my existing horizontal belt holster
 However, early on I found the 3G reception indoors at home marginal, never actually dropping calls, but making normal conversations difficult, with audio gaps at both ends
 Although the phone is represented as "U
S
 Version", the phone's specific "type" is RM-721 (900/1900/2100), which omits the important U
S
 inside-building frequency of 850 MHz
 A better flavor of this phone for the U
S
 would be type RM-722, supporting 850/1900/2100 MHz frequencies, but I was not able to find this type for sale anywhere
Searched again on the Internet and through Amazon, and found the Nokia 301
2
 While it's a bit larger (2
4 in
 display), and a tight fit in my old Krusell holster, the item's Amazon title shows support for both U
S
 3G frequencies (850/1900; type RM-841)
 Very similar features to the C2-01
5, with its simple but battle-tested Symbian-derived S40 operating system
 And it's newer, with first ship in April 2013, so should theoretically have a longer service life
 The phone works great indoors and outdoors in my area, but the RM-841 type will have no 3G support in Europe
So my final solution is to keep both phones
 The 301
2 will be my standard U
S
 phone, and the C2-01
5 will substitute on any occasional retiree trips to Europe or the Far East
 Both phones have solid Nokia build quality, and are really best-of-breed for this type of simple "candy bar" phone
 Both are unlocked, and worked immediately when I dropped my existing 3G-capable AT&T SIM into them
 And both support quad-band GSM (850/900/1800/1900), so should work on these older 2G frequencies worldwide for as long as they continue to be supported

Great Phone
 Long-lasting battery
 Easy to use
 No Wifi, but internet connection and emails available if you have a plan with data
 It has a slot that fits a micro memory card
 Solid and resistant
 I would buy it again

EXCELENTE PRODUCTO
Amazing simple and beautifoul candy bar cell phone

basic phone for all those who don't like to spend most of their time looking to their phones


"Aka smart-phones"

Nokia always has nice phones





Fine
to big for a candy bar phone

excellent


excellent product, thank you very much 



Not bad but can be better
I purchased a few of these phones before I finally went to a smart phone
 The nokia 301
2 is a great basic phone
 Easy to use and very durable

Warning
 The unit I received had a charger that would not work with North American 110V outlets
 It should be noted that that this phone cannot be charged in the US even though the description indicates that it will

It's cute
 The same if a Hershey bar

I had to return this phone because it wasn't a 301
2 as advertized
 It was actually a 301
1
 My first clue was that the box had a sticker placed over the original sticker saying that it was a 301
2
 Peeled the sticker off and the sticker underneath said it was a 301
1
 Then I opened the back cover of the phone and viewed the sticker on the phone and it said 301
1
 The next thing I noticed was that the AC charger would not plug into a normal USA recepticle making it totally useless without some kind of adapter
 The next thing I tried was to put my sim card in the phone and check for service
 The phone would work in GSM mode and combo mode but not in 3G mode
 This tells me that the 3G is not for USA meaning that when AT&T stops supporting GSM and goes 3 & 4 G only, this phone will stop working
 Also, unrelated to the modle number, I could not get the blue tooth to stayed paired or reconnect to my 2015 Toyota Corolla
I gave the phone 3 stars because I liked the phone's overall quality build and speaker phone volume and ease of use
 Call quality was very good and I would have probably given it a 5 star rating if it had been the phone they advertized
 Not sure if the blue tooth was defective or if it might have worked on the 301
2

It was just what I expected and works well

The phone is of high quality and connected fine in 2G mode, but would not connect in 3G mode with my AT&T cellular service in Maryland, USA
 The reason became apparent when I discovered that the 301
1 version was sent with a non-mfg label over mfg label stating it was 301
2
 The manufacturer label (and label under battery cover - see photos) showed clearly that this was the 301
1 version, which has 900/2100 WCDMA and will not allow 3G on AT&T in the USA
 I returned it less then 2 hours after opening it since the sole reason I purchased the phone was because AT&T is dropping 2G service in my area by the end of 2016, and it seems they have already been decommissioning 2G on some towers as my coverage has gotten worse on my 2G-only cell phone
 Both sellers using Amazon fulfillment appear to be shipping the 301
1 version instead of the 301
2 version described on the product page - this is evidenced by the user reviews
 Buyer beware - this phone will not provide 3G service in the USA

This ok
Excellent
Something basic and without the bells and whistles that are sheer gimmicks for ego-ridden consumer mania

ok
I **Loved** this phone
 It was perfect for what I needed
 I received it two days ago
On day 1, after working properly for hours, the screen went to white
 I could do nothing with the phone
 After several battery pulls and reboots, I finally got it to turn on
 I thought it was a fluke, as the remainder of the day, the phone worked as promised
 Excellent excellent feature phone
Fast forward to this morning
 The phone randomly rebooted to the white screen again - except this time, I could not get it to turn back on properly
 I'm very disappointed
 I dropped it off at UPS already for a return
 After doing so, I searched online and found the "white screen" issue is a problem with this model
 :-(Again, this was a perfect feature phone for me and I wish I could've kept it
 Sadly, it had to go back

I'm using this on AT&T around Dallas, Texas
 I've been switching between GSM and 3G because one gives me more bars in certain situations
 It's replacing my Nokia Lumia 520 which I have used for a few months now, but am starting to get tired of all the carriers fighting about smartphone plans and wanted to get myself out of that mess by ditching mine and going on the GoPhone feature phone plans
And I really don't regret it
The phone itself is made out of this really nice and smooth premium plastic
 It feels great in the hand
 The keypad lights up and is very easy to use
 The directional-pad is pretty good too
 I really like that the MicroSD slot is on the side and not in the back like the 520
 The charging port bugs me that it's on the top, but at least I can reuse my old one and have a backup
I haven't tried the camera yet, but the software has so many point-and-shoot like features
 You can also actually shoot video much easier than the 520 (I still haven't found out how to without an extra app, heh)
The Series 40 operating system is great
 Really, really nice and robust for dumb phone software
 The built-in productivity apps aren't all that fancy, but are very valuable once you start inputting the data
 The best thing that you can push things to the SD card for easy exporting
 You can easily add your own 
jar apps by sending it to the phone via Bluetooth
 It worked instantly with my Late 2011 MacBook Pro
 Sonic Advance and Block Breaker 3 are two games I've tried with it so far and they play nicely
 Albite Reader works great for ePubs too, not that I plan on reading much on here, but it's good for some offline longform
I was also able to print to my Polaroid PoGo printer with it
Plugging in some headphones also gives you access to local radio
 Unlike the 520, it lets you pull up the RDS, but it doesn't sound as good, even in stereo
 It lets you record though
Call quality itself is very good too
 I've only called AT&T this far in, but it sounded good
Overall I'm pretty happy with it
 I have a new 64GB iPod Touch I'm going to use alongside it, so I'm not going to miss too much

hey this phone is awesome if you don't want a huge touch screen 2-hour battery-lasting phone that falls and breaks
for Nokia oldschool phone fans, this is it
 however, don't assume the battery life lasts like the old Nokia1100 and all

 but still, lasts way longer than the new smartphones' batteries
 bye
Charged it up before going to Costa Rica
 In the airport baggage area while waiting for my bags I went over to the ICE Sim card sales desk and in less than 10 minutes had purchased 200 minute prepaid Sim card for $5
 The phone takes me back to the "old" days of cell phones 


 but I have to say that the reception and speaker/mic quality was top notch
 Typical Nokia quality 


 Great phone at twice the price

for me it works well for my purposes
 I just need a phone to place and receive calls and messages if I cannot answer
 I had wanted the Nokia 500 series as it has a dual sim card slot - but that series is not available for the US market as yet


thanks

It does what it's supposed to do very well
 It's very durable too I dropped it from about 7 feet in the air and it bounced another couple feet off the ground and it had no scratches afterwards and it still works fine

Well, after waiting for so long time to get one cellphone to my mom, I finally found this
It's the perfect gift for her needs
Its fast, photo is very good

I Recomend this
 It's Nokia



This phone is small, quad band, it is nice to look at but has many limitations:1
 Very low volume, both on the small speaker and on the speakerphone
2
 Poor RF sensitivity in low signal areas
3
 Complicated menu- this is supposed to be SIMPLE phone, but stupidity of Nokia programmers is unlimited
 There is almost no action that doesn't require at least 3-4 button clicks



This is a GREAT phone for the many, many of us that want a PHONE, not an overpriced piece of techno glitter with a bazillion features we neither want nor use
 Why U
S
 cellular providers do not offer this or similar phones is a mystery to me
It's classic Nokia - solid build, clear and logical user interface, real keyboard, good size clear display, camera that's fine for the occasional quick photo and it's affordable
 As to the power consumption issue that has appeared in some European reviews, I just don't see it - I fully charged the phone over 2 days ago, have left it on - with Bluetooth enabled - and made several calls and the battery shows 75% full
 Works for me 

An avid smartphone user for 6 years now, I bought this 301 this week to augment my Berry for those weekends and other times when I don't need the full pocket computer rolling
 Battery life has been solid so far
 Need to still do a full run-down test, yet the four bars keep staying on for a nice, long time
 This review is a first impression
Don't let the 1990's look fool you, it's packing 3
5G (T-Mobile 4G for me) underneath this fully global, quad-band factory unlocked package
 For not much more than a dual-band, I upgraded to the quad-band for some planned travel this coming year, and this should do the job quickly and happily
 While it's nice to be "unplugged" from back home, it's a solid setup to be able to tie into web browsing and the email apps for Google, Yahoo, and Exchange built in
 This won't replace your typical 4-6" touch screen device for video consumption, however it loaded up my 32GB SD card that I use in my other device and played audio tracks within two minutes
I don't see this replacing my smartphone needs with work and such, however it has been a joy as a number two phone, ideal for those nights out when you are expecting a phone call/text and may want to hop on the web while waiting in line or whatnot
 Bust out this 301 and pop onto the Xpress Browser or email your friend on their big screen pocket computer/phone and be prepared to see some shocked faces
 This thing cooks
 I wish that it would be sold in stores, however I'm a happy Amazon customer and this device seems to hit a nice medium between "dumb phone" and "smart phone" with sharp, near landline call quality and quick T9 typing
With the ability to quickly swap out the SIM from my Berry to this 301, I've got a fun and useful duo for the same price as compared to upgrading to popular 32 GB models of other smartphones, while using the latest iterations of some longtime players in this still, relatively new field
In sum, I'm impressed
 I haven't had a Nokia since before my work BlackBerry days, yet I can tell you this, this is a great second SIM phone for those of us tethered to those devices and a solid telecommunication device, complete with up to date wireless tech baked in
 If you're looking for a phone that does the talking thing with a clear voice, look no further

I was very excited to get this phone
 I read lots of negative reviews about the battery life, but many sources I read noted that the battery life problems were fixed after a certain firmware version
 This is not true at all
 I previously had a Nokia 2320 ($20 Go phone model), and I got over a week of battery life on that phone
 This phone was advertised to get 37 days of standby battery life
 I get less than 5 days, and I am an extremely low usage person with my phone
 I like features of this phone
 I like nearly everything about it, but the reason I got this phone was so that I could not bother with having to charge it but a couple times a month
 In that regard, this phone fails miserably
 I am very disappointed with it

Good buy
 Looks solid and good for basic use

no need to worry about government tacking you with this high quality phone, there is NO GPS

 everything i need in a phone, great signal strength amazing battery life and very durable
This would be a great simple phone, but it is lacking the option to alert you of missed calls/messages/calendar events
 It rings once when you receive the call/text/event, but afterwords you have no way of knowing that you missed an alert
 No secondary ring
 No flashing light
 Nothing
 There are no apps to download that can fix this issue
 I even called Nokia customer support who reaffirmed that this is built in to the phone and has no fix
In my opinion this is unacceptable in a modern phone

I love this phone

Excellent quality, feels like it's made out of top notch materials, and it's very stylish looking
 The speaker is amazing on this phone
 I highly recommend for people who want a simple phone but also want 3G compatibility
 Battery life has thus far been excellent
 My only complaint is the keys on the keypad feel somewhat loose, I much prefer the rubberized, dustproof keyboard found in other Nokia feature phones

great
It was amazing
great non-smartphone phone

slightly heavy look, little pricy as well compared to my other X3
Waste of money
 Phone was dead out of box
 I was not able to return it due to expiration of return period

I bought this phone for my dad
 He loves it
 Dad was able to explore many of the phone's features while he was talking to me using this phone
 He said that he had to turn the volume down while using headphones and he said that the lettering on the screen was better than his old phone ( an Alltel SCH-U450 )

It would be nice if it didn't ask for location when you first turn it on
 3G in it is unnecessary

Bought this for my brother since he's more comfortable with a physical keyboard than touch screen
 He's very happy now he doesn't need to struggle with the screen every time when the phone ring

I love this phone, plain and simple
I actually thought about buying ANOTHER one just in case anything happened to the one I have now
My only complaint was that it didnt support official 4G but I mean what can you expect
Other than that, this phone definitely deserves a 5 out of 5

Does not do what all earlier nokia models do
 Terrible battery life
 Poor reception
 Terrible call quality, speakerphone unusable
 Heavy and surprisingly large
 Had to go back to my C2

To my great disappointment the phone I received can only take one sim card at a time
 Both the textual description and picture indicated that the phone was equipped with a second sim slot
The labels on the box and the phone says Nokia 301
2, and it has only an internal slot for a sim card
 The external second slot is missing
I am very disappointed

Doesn't have wifi; and I can't give it back becouse I live in another country, I'm trough disappointed with nokia
Bought this phone to use in France
 Upon arriving in France I found it was not unlocked and unusable in France

Phone was really unlocked and works perfectly
 The sound evrything was designed to place quality calls
 I will buy it again if i have to
Didn't match with what the discrpition were on site 
 Would never advice anyone to buy this
I've used this phone for 1 and a half years now, and has not let me down, especially for a basic phone
 Expandable memory is a life saver

It works well

nice phone if you just want a phone with good battery life and talks pretty good i fringe areas
Works, i take it everywhere, 
 I use it when i don't want to be distracted with the smart phone

I LOVE THIS PHONE
 I'm not much for "fancy" gadgets but this phone does alot for me and serves my purpose very well
 I have used it when traveling across the US and in Africa and the clarity is good
 The simplicity is the phone's best feature
 Nokia is a very trusted name in phones
 I have purchased others as gifts but this one is my personal choice

i love it because they are heavy and good for holding on hand but they have some problems the charger hole get broken easily ,its lost all numbers on contacts and log if you turn off the phone some time 
so i dont want to buy it in the future
Not sure what the deal is, but my battery life isn't nearly what I'd expect out of a modest feature phone
 Otherwise it's a fine specimen

We wanted to take an unlocked quad-band phone for our trip to Costa Rica, to have an "emergency only" phone
 This phone served that purpose
 The only initial problem was that the included charger has an unusual plug
 I have no idea which country/ies this plug works in, but it definitely doesn't work in the US, Costa Rica, or Switzerland (another country I hope to use this phone in)
 I didn't check the plug before I left for Costa Rica and was very upset, at both the seller for not including an US plug, and at myself for not checking/noticing the wrong plug when I received the phone
 Of course, without being able to charge the phone, it would have been utterly useless
 However, I also have a Sony digital camera and, as luck would have it, its charger also charged this phone and so we were able to use it after all
 Overall, the phone seemed to be of good quality
 It has various features, but I didn't try any of them, only made one phone call and received one text, both of which worked just fine
 I'm happy with this purchase, but am deducting one star for the US-incompatible charger/plug
 The description of the product made no mention of the plug, but did mention that the phone would work in the US, which to me implies that its charger would also work here
 It does not

Good phone just as I thought it will be but the face scratches easily
 I was putting it in and out of my jeans pocket as I do all other phones and in 2 days the surface got scratched but asides that - the phone is perfect

My husband tells me it's a fine Nokia cell phone, but because he's Italian and uses it primarily in Italy, he finds some difficulty with no italian language selection

I rated only 4 stars because it's camera and loud speaker needs to be corrected/reformed
It is good but not the best product
I recommend to get to those who want to use basic phones

Overall it is very good phone and most of it's good comes from absense of touch technology which is sux
UI response is very fast, you don't have to wait while media player is opening or smth else
I don't use mobile internet (never used) so I know nothing about how it works with this phone
Body is very good made - no gaps or smth like this
It is heavier then it looks but it's advantage for me
I managed to connect it to Nokia PC Suite (not Nokia Suite) to copy new music, but I found thatjust copying mp3 with tags to corresponding folders on Micro SD card is faster and easier
I use free mp3tag app to set tags to multiple mp3 files at once
Media player supports playlists, albums, artists, genres
Photo size is 1536x2048
Pros:Fast, non-touch, very good look and feel
Missed, received and dialed numbers are in one list which shows up when you press Send button
Music sound (with good earphones) is very, very good - it is louder than on my previousNokia 5800XM which is music-oriented, so to speak
Supports A2DP bluetooth profile, so I use it in the car w/o problems so far
Photo camera is very good too - self portrate, panorama, smth else which I'm not going to use
Simple photo editor
Photo gallery supports timeline mode - see photos specific to this date, press right and left to go to next/prev date
Video recording
Simulated calls - if you really need it
Feature to record current call
Can customize any function to right/left or 4 middle buttons
Can customize where to display contacts from - SIM, phone or both
Timed profiles (but Flight profile cannot be timed)
Cons:Ringer is not so loud as it could be - can miss a call in noisy environment
Vibro is not very strong
Battery lasts for ~4 days (with very moderate usage of music player) which is not as much as I expected
No way to remove not needed apps and games like Facebook, Twitter etc
When turned on 1st time it tries to send some text message to Nokia -I've text messages blocked so I got notification about unsuccessfull attempt to send it
Screen is very scratchable, buy a screen protector
Wish it have a flashlight))
Advice: turn of 3G in menu if you are not using Internet - battery should last longer

I love my basic phone, nothing like a simple phone used to make calls and text
 Battery life is amazing compared to my smartphone and I'm saving a ton of money each month by getting rid of the smartphone

I would have been happier if this phone was a dual SIM model as, is available and advertised for 301
2 unlocked quad-band world phones
 A USB cable would also have enhanced the rating
 I am otherwise satisfied and happy with the phone
 It is lovely to find an "old school" phone that features such a high standard of functionality and quality

It was a great phone while it lasted
 The phone worked well, it was very high quality for a feature phone, and had plenty of apps that made it border on the realm of a semi-smart phone
However, five days into using it, I was notified that there was a system software update
 It warned about using a high amount of bandwidth (1MB update), and recommended that the battery was over halfway charged
 I made sure everything was fine and good to go
 After the phone rebooted, a progressbar came on, finished, and then NOTHING
 The phone doesn't turn on anymore, it gets recognized by my computers for about three seconds before it can't be detected (in a ROM mode no less), and even when it gets detected, all of Nokia's recovery programs fail to work
Overall it was a great phone for five days
 I would have loved it had the thing been able to update properly
 One more thing: You can't even update it via USB, the only way to update the phone is OTA (Over The Air)
 That seems like a serious issue

I downgraded because the smart phone is such a hog of time
 This fits the bill, works well so far in the US with T-mobile, and looks slick
 The menus and organization is all over the place, probably because I'm used to smart phone, so it takes some familiarizing
 But I no longer check mail, find direction, check traffic, etc
 while driving, so peaceful

I really love this phone
 It's got better reception than my iPhone 4, and sounds better as well
 Way less dropped calls
 I travel a lot, and gauged that over the span of a 240 mile round trip I used to get cut off at about 12 different spots with my iPhone 4, whereas this phone only drops calls at 2 spots, and that's occasionally
 More often the call just gets distorted until I pick up a new tower
The interface is nothing to get excited about, but the small form factor is great
 Very light, yet durable
 I fits in the coin pocket of my favorite jeans
 The ability to access the micro SD without opening the phone is nice
I recently bought a Samsung Rugged II to replace this while I duke it out with AT&T whether this phone is "smart" of not, and feel like I am poised to lose the battle
 I will be sad if so, because the Samsung can't hold a candle to this
AT&T is telling me their network identifies my phone as an Acer Laptop, and there is nothing they can do about it, since it is not one of their phones
UPDATE: A rep at the AT&T store input some generic code to tell the system it's a basic phone
 All is well now

I had to replace my 10 year old Nokia flip phone
 I love Nokia and this little phone is perfect
 It is not a smartphone, but I did not want to have to pay hefty monthly fees for a smartphone
 Connection to the internet on At&T's Pay as you Go plan would require a $60 a month data plan
 With this phone, I pay $25 every three months and I can access the internet as well
 Since I don't use it often, it's just perfect for me

Came from an iPhone 5 to this phone in a long story
 Like this little thing a lot
 I'm not glued to it like an iPhone but if I get really bored and can still get on Facebook and Twitter
 Once you get all your shortcuts set up the phone is golden
 Even dropped it just today


 :) in Nokia fashion is survived and the asphalt was destroyed
 Not a statch


 Love it

The phone itself is nicely designed and offers pretty much exactly what you'd expect in terms of calls, texts, camera, etc
 My major complaint is what appears to be a hardware issue with the phone that I've read about in other venues since experiencing it: the screen intermittently goes completely white and the phone will not respond to anything
 Most of the time removing the battery solves the problem, but sometimes it doesn't and I just have to wait it out
 It happens at least once a day

Great basic little phone

Amazing phone


 Back to the basics for me
 I'm getting 4+ days battery life on T-mobile

nice
Great battery life, fine call quality, annoying screen resolution and OS
 Product was in perfect, absolutely new condition, exactly as described by the seller, I'm just not a fan of the usability of this OS compared to other feature phones I've had

Good product
 Light weight and handy

Good product
 Light weight and convenient

Excellent phone
 Arrived as advertised
 A bit pricey for "just a phone" - but some people don't do well with Smartphones, and this is a genuine Nokia, solid as a tank and very familiar interface

easy to use and kind of pretty (for the price)my mom is really happy
This is really a amazing simple 3
5G phone
 It's great because I got this for my Grandma and she finds it really simple to use
 The screen is nice and the buttons are easy to press
 The build quality is just amazing, it feels solid like a brick except that it's easy light and nice to hold, it feels great in your hands
 This is a semi smart phone because it has certain social networking apps so it can be useful for people who are new to the smartphone business or are light users
 Also it does not have wifi so you need a data connection to enjoy all the convenience of internet enables applications
 The call quality is great, at least for me but my grandma found it weird, but that may just be her
 The OS is again really simple so it's great for all users and the physical build quality is also very good
 I would recommend this to everyone looking for a simple but great phone

I'm using this on AT&T around Dallas, Texas
 I've been switching between GSM and 3G because one gives me more bars in certain situations
 It's replacing my Nokia Lumia 520 which I have used for a few months now, but am starting to get tired of all the carriers fighting about smartphone plans and wanted to get myself out of that mess by ditching mine and going on the GoPhone feature phone plans
And I really don't regret it
The phone itself is made out of this really nice and smooth premium plastic
 It feels great in the hand
 The keypad lights up and is very easy to use
 The directional-pad is pretty good too
 I really like that the MicroSD slot is on the side and not in the back like the 520
 The charging port bugs me that it's on the top, but at least I can reuse my old one and have a backup
I haven't tried the camera yet, but the software has so many point-and-shoot like features
 You can also actually shoot video much easier than the 520 (I still haven't found out how to without an extra app, heh)
The Series 40 operating system is great
 Really, really nice and robust for dumb phone software
 The built-in productivity apps aren't all that fancy, but are very valuable once you start inputting the data
 The best thing that you can push things to the SD card for easy exporting
 You can easily add your own 
jar apps by sending it to the phone via Bluetooth
 It worked instantly with my Late 2011 MacBook Pro
 Sonic Advance and Block Breaker 3 are two games I've tried with it so far and they play nicely
 Albite Reader works great for ePubs too, not that I plan on reading much on here, but it's good for some offline longform
I was also able to print to my Polaroid PoGo printer with it
Plugging in some headphones also gives you access to local radio
 Unlike the 520, it lets you pull up the RDS, but it doesn't sound as good, even in stereo
 It lets you record though
Call quality itself is very good too
 I've only called AT&T this far in, but it sounded good
Overall I'm pretty happy with it
 I have a new 64GB iPod Touch I'm going to use alongside it, so I'm not going to miss too much

hey this phone is awesome if you don't want a huge touch screen 2-hour battery-lasting phone that falls and breaks
for Nokia oldschool phone fans, this is it
 however, don't assume the battery life lasts like the old Nokia1100 and all

 but still, lasts way longer than the new smartphones' batteries
 bye
Charged it up before going to Costa Rica
 In the airport baggage area while waiting for my bags I went over to the ICE Sim card sales desk and in less than 10 minutes had purchased 200 minute prepaid Sim card for $5
 The phone takes me back to the "old" days of cell phones 


 but I have to say that the reception and speaker/mic quality was top notch
 Typical Nokia quality 


 Great phone at twice the price

for me it works well for my purposes
 I just need a phone to place and receive calls and messages if I cannot answer
 I had wanted the Nokia 500 series as it has a dual sim card slot - but that series is not available for the US market as yet


thanks

It does what it's supposed to do very well
 It's very durable too I dropped it from about 7 feet in the air and it bounced another couple feet off the ground and it had no scratches afterwards and it still works fine

Well, after waiting for so long time to get one cellphone to my mom, I finally found this
It's the perfect gift for her needs
Its fast, photo is very good

I Recomend this
 It's Nokia



This phone is small, quad band, it is nice to look at but has many limitations:1
 Very low volume, both on the small speaker and on the speakerphone
2
 Poor RF sensitivity in low signal areas
3
 Complicated menu- this is supposed to be SIMPLE phone, but stupidity of Nokia programmers is unlimited
 There is almost no action that doesn't require at least 3-4 button clicks



This is a GREAT phone for the many, many of us that want a PHONE, not an overpriced piece of techno glitter with a bazillion features we neither want nor use
 Why U
S
 cellular providers do not offer this or similar phones is a mystery to me
It's classic Nokia - solid build, clear and logical user interface, real keyboard, good size clear display, camera that's fine for the occasional quick photo and it's affordable
 As to the power consumption issue that has appeared in some European reviews, I just don't see it - I fully charged the phone over 2 days ago, have left it on - with Bluetooth enabled - and made several calls and the battery shows 75% full
 Works for me 

An avid smartphone user for 6 years now, I bought this 301 this week to augment my Berry for those weekends and other times when I don't need the full pocket computer rolling
 Battery life has been solid so far
 Need to still do a full run-down test, yet the four bars keep staying on for a nice, long time
 This review is a first impression
Don't let the 1990's look fool you, it's packing 3
5G (T-Mobile 4G for me) underneath this fully global, quad-band factory unlocked package
 For not much more than a dual-band, I upgraded to the quad-band for some planned travel this coming year, and this should do the job quickly and happily
 While it's nice to be "unplugged" from back home, it's a solid setup to be able to tie into web browsing and the email apps for Google, Yahoo, and Exchange built in
 This won't replace your typical 4-6" touch screen device for video consumption, however it loaded up my 32GB SD card that I use in my other device and played audio tracks within two minutes
I don't see this replacing my smartphone needs with work and such, however it has been a joy as a number two phone, ideal for those nights out when you are expecting a phone call/text and may want to hop on the web while waiting in line or whatnot
 Bust out this 301 and pop onto the Xpress Browser or email your friend on their big screen pocket computer/phone and be prepared to see some shocked faces
 This thing cooks
 I wish that it would be sold in stores, however I'm a happy Amazon customer and this device seems to hit a nice medium between "dumb phone" and "smart phone" with sharp, near landline call quality and quick T9 typing
With the ability to quickly swap out the SIM from my Berry to this 301, I've got a fun and useful duo for the same price as compared to upgrading to popular 32 GB models of other smartphones, while using the latest iterations of some longtime players in this still, relatively new field
In sum, I'm impressed
 I haven't had a Nokia since before my work BlackBerry days, yet I can tell you this, this is a great second SIM phone for those of us tethered to those devices and a solid telecommunication device, complete with up to date wireless tech baked in
 If you're looking for a phone that does the talking thing with a clear voice, look no further

I was very excited to get this phone
 I read lots of negative reviews about the battery life, but many sources I read noted that the battery life problems were fixed after a certain firmware version
 This is not true at all
 I previously had a Nokia 2320 ($20 Go phone model), and I got over a week of battery life on that phone
 This phone was advertised to get 37 days of standby battery life
 I get less than 5 days, and I am an extremely low usage person with my phone
 I like features of this phone
 I like nearly everything about it, but the reason I got this phone was so that I could not bother with having to charge it but a couple times a month
 In that regard, this phone fails miserably
 I am very disappointed with it

Good buy
 Looks solid and good for basic use

no need to worry about government tacking you with this high quality phone, there is NO GPS

 everything i need in a phone, great signal strength amazing battery life and very durable
This would be a great simple phone, but it is lacking the option to alert you of missed calls/messages/calendar events
 It rings once when you receive the call/text/event, but afterwords you have no way of knowing that you missed an alert
 No secondary ring
 No flashing light
 Nothing
 There are no apps to download that can fix this issue
 I even called Nokia customer support who reaffirmed that this is built in to the phone and has no fix
In my opinion this is unacceptable in a modern phone

I love this phone

Excellent quality, feels like it's made out of top notch materials, and it's very stylish looking
 The speaker is amazing on this phone
 I highly recommend for people who want a simple phone but also want 3G compatibility
 Battery life has thus far been excellent
 My only complaint is the keys on the keypad feel somewhat loose, I much prefer the rubberized, dustproof keyboard found in other Nokia feature phones

great
It was amazing
great non-smartphone phone

slightly heavy look, little pricy as well compared to my other X3
I'm going to try to post the same review for two different Nokia "feature" phones, both of which I've bought through Amazon
 First some context: I'm a geezer who likes dumb phones
 I want a phone that will allow me to make and receive voice calls, and send and receive occasional text messages
 That's it
 No social networking, no automatic touch-and-pay capability, no spoken driving directions, etc
 My previous phone, which I owned for about 8 years, was a Nokia 6030
 Great phone
Recent phone calls and mailings from carrier AT&T warned me that my "phone will no longer be supported" after 11/30/14 in my service area in NorCal
 I have a little technical background, but am not a phone geek
 Had to do a bit of research on phone bandwidths, frequencies, and "generations"
 I wanted to understand why my old phone had finally reached end-of-life, and to pick a replacement that would provide similar capabilities and a long-as-possible future life
 Hopefully this research will be helpful to others who face the same situation down the road
My old 6030 was a "GSM-only" phone
 I had found on trips to Europe that it's also a U
S
-only phone
 GSM is sometimes referred to as "2G", and it's this 2G function that AT&T is in the process of dismantling across the U
S
, ending with final shutdown by 12/16
 So I was looking for a 3G or better replacement phone
Both 2G and 3G generations of phones use different wireless frequencies in the U
S
 (and Latin America) vs
 the rest of the world (ROW)
 U
S
 3G runs 850 & 1900 MHz, with the lower "more flexible" frequency working better on insides of buildings
 ROW 3G runs 900 & 2100 MHz
I initially chose the Nokia C2-01
5 for its small size (2-in
 display), closest to my old 6030, and fitting nicely in my existing horizontal belt holster
 However, early on I found the 3G reception indoors at home marginal, never actually dropping calls, but making normal conversations difficult, with audio gaps at both ends
 Although the phone is represented as "U
S
 Version", the phone's specific "type" is RM-721 (900/1900/2100), which omits the important U
S
 inside-building frequency of 850 MHz
 A better flavor of this phone for the U
S
 would be type RM-722, supporting 850/1900/2100 MHz frequencies, but I was not able to find this type for sale anywhere
Searched again on the Internet and through Amazon, and found the Nokia 301
2
 While it's a bit larger (2
4 in
 display), and a tight fit in my old Krusell holster, the item's Amazon title shows support for both U
S
 3G frequencies (850/1900; type RM-841)
 Very similar features to the C2-01
5, with its simple but battle-tested Symbian-derived S40 operating system
 And it's newer, with first ship in April 2013, so should theoretically have a longer service life
 The phone works great indoors and outdoors in my area, but the RM-841 type will have no 3G support in Europe
So my final solution is to keep both phones
 The 301
2 will be my standard U
S
 phone, and the C2-01
5 will substitute on any occasional retiree trips to Europe or the Far East
 Both phones have solid Nokia build quality, and are really best-of-breed for this type of simple "candy bar" phone
 Both are unlocked, and worked immediately when I dropped my existing 3G-capable AT&T SIM into them
 And both support quad-band GSM (850/900/1800/1900), so should work on these older 2G frequencies worldwide for as long as they continue to be supported

Great Phone
 Long-lasting battery
 Easy to use
 No Wifi, but internet connection and emails available if you have a plan with data
 It has a slot that fits a micro memory card
 Solid and resistant
 I would buy it again

EXCELENTE PRODUCTO
Amazing simple and beautifoul candy bar cell phone

basic phone for all those who don't like to spend most of their time looking to their phones


"Aka smart-phones"

Nokia always has nice phones





Fine
to big for a candy bar phone

excellent


excellent product, thank you very much 



Not bad but can be better
I purchased a few of these phones before I finally went to a smart phone
 The nokia 301
2 is a great basic phone
 Easy to use and very durable

Good luck
very nice to use a wonderful semi-smart phone
very good phone, old fashion
Excelente producto

Originally bought 1/28/2014
 Amazon changed the date of my review when I updated/edited a few things in 2015
 I made a second edit 8/28/2016
 See end of review for this update
I have been searching for a feature phone since my trusty Sony 580 died over a year ago
 I neither have, nor want, a data plan
 I don't use internet on my phone
 I was happy to find that Nokia was still developing for this market with something more than your bottom-of-the-barrel Go-Phone, which is what I had been using since the demise of my Sony
I have had the phone about a year
 I don't love it like I did my Sony, even though it has some features that are better than the Sony, like standard jacks
 Here are my opinions/experiences with this phone:  Pros:        1
)  It works as a phone - I can hear my callers and they can hear me
 When set on full volume, calls through the handset are uncomfortably loud
 (Not so much through the speakerphone - see Cons, below
) Clarity could be better - the sound IS NOT comparable to a land line phone - but voices are less muffled than on the cheap Go-phones with which we've been making-do
 I've never had a smart phone, so can't compare the sound quality to a high-end phone
2
)  It has 10 alarms that can be set for any day of the week or one time only, with a snooze function that is variable between 2 & 59 minutes
 You can choose your alarm tone
3
) The calendar has multiple choices of reminders, including birthday and anniversary that calculate age and are set for the life of the phone
 You can also set these reminders through the directory
4
) The calculator has the normal calculator functions, but can also be used as a scientific or a loan calculator
 It also has these common choices: 1/x; %; square root; x squared; MS (memory store); MR (memory recall); C (clear); and plus-minus
5
)  Notes and To-do lists
 As a trial, I put in 21 To-Dos and 30 Notes
 30 is the limit for notes
 Probably the same for To-Dos
6
) Speakerphone/loudspeaker for calls and music  7
) Stopwatch8
) Countdown timer with alarm9
)  You can set it to 3G, GSM or dual mode
 Better battery life with GSM
10
)  Flight Mode
 Easily accessible
11
)  You can add units to the conversion calculator
 This is particularly useful since this phone was not developed for the US and many US equivalents were not included
 For instance, there is a conversion for Acres to Square Kilometers but not to Square Miles
 The is even a folder for "Lifestyle" conversions to add equivalents not found elsewhere
 I added Miles per Hour vs
 Kilometers per Hour, as there is no velocity converter
 All converters are backwards compatible
12
)  Unit lights up briefly to alert you when fully charged, but does not play a tone
 This is infinitely better than my Go-Phone that would awaken me when I was charging the battery overnight
13
)  You can opt out of emergency alerts
 My Go-Phone had no such option
 Amber/Silver alerts are important, but not in the middle of the night or when I get an alert from 300 miles away
 I can opt in again if weather alerts are likely
14
)  You can set an access code separate from a pin code to control access to certain operations like the browser,  app purchases and downloads
15
)  You can set a time limit on your phone Profile (normal, silent, meeting, etc
) so you don't have to worry about forgetting to reset your phone after you've been to the movies, etc
16
)  I had no trouble with MMS messaging
 I didn't have to do anything to set this up with ATT
 It worked right out of the box
 Unlike some other  reviewers, my phone is recognized as a "dumb phone" by ATT
 17
)  Has a radio and a music player
 I have some issues with ringer & speakerphone volume, but not with radio & music volume
 I often listen to podcasts & I can hear the spoken word clearly without earbuds
 Radio only works with earbuds, as earbuds function as antenna
 You can set it to play through the earbuds or through the speakerphone speaker
 3
5mm standard earbud jack
(Update: got a tablet that is much more convenient for podcasts
 Still use the phone as a radio and love this function
)18
) Standard micro USB charging jack
 Infinitely preferable to proprietary jacks
19
) Programable left and right selection keys
 I programed my left key for a list of shortcuts to tools/apps that I either use infrequently or are difficult to remember how to access
  My right key is programed to take me to my address book
20
) Programable soft keys
 A straight press of the central Navigation key takes you to the Menu screen
 Pressing the sides of the Navigation key up, down, left or right functions as soft keys
 You can program these soft keys with frequently used shortcuts, like Create a Message, or to take you to the Calendar or Calculator
21
) You can designate one person as your most frequent text recipient
 Very convenient
22
)  The home screen is divided into four four separate sections for very frequently used items
 The top section is slightly bigger than the others
 You can choose from 10 items or you have the option to leave a section blank
 Choices are: Calendar, Clock, Countdown Timer, General Indicators (I have no idea what this is
 When chosen, it simply reads "empty
"), Mail for Exchange, Mail, Notifications, Radio & Media, Shortcut Bar, SocialAccount or (empty)
  I use the first section to display the time
 On the next, I display the date, which also shows the next calendar entry, if there is one
 My third section choice is Shortcut Bar, from which I can choose from 53 different shortcuts
 Obviously, these shortcut choices are expanded from the original 10 choices given above
 (This Shortcuts BAR is also different from the Shortcuts LIST I set up as accessible through my left selection key
) Some of the expanded choices: alarms, camera, calculator, etc
 I currently have 15 items on this shortcut bar
 I don't know if there is a limit or if you can choose all 53 shortcuts
  My fourth section is the countdown timer
 I don't really use it all that often, but learned that this is the only way to easily display how much time is left on the timer when I do need a timer
Cons:1
)  There is no Tools file, but there are TWO Apps files
Apps file contains:  GamesAlarm clockCalculatorFilesVoice recorderTo-do ListNotesCountdown timerStopwatchAlso, within the Apps file is a folder called My Apps which contains: eBuddy (a now defunct chat app that eats up 615 kb)FacebookGoal (a soccer app, for pete's sake, that eats up 231 kb
)Mail for ExchangeNews and OffersNokia NearbyNotificationsSocialAccounts (to manage social networking)Store (Nokia app store to buy apps)The Weather ChannelTuneWikiTwitterWhatsAppand World Clock
 In addition, there is ANOTHER icon on the Menu Page called More Apps, to store all the apps you buy or download
 Can we perhaps have just ONE apps file for ALL the apps and a separate Tools file
 Oh, and Calendar is a file by itself on the Menu Page
 Might have been a good place for TOOLS
 (Just saying


)2
) I cannot delete any of the pre-loaded apps from the phone
 I equate this to bloatware
 I am perfectly capable of choosing my own apps, thank you
3
) In order to delete any of the pre-loaded apps, (Facebook, WhatsApp, Mail for Exchange), from the shortcuts list, (the one I access from my left selection key), you have to go to Options, Select Options, open Applications List, then unmark the pre-loaded apps, then press Done
 Took me a week of playing around to figure this out
 Most of the other tools you might want on a shortcut are simply listed under Options
 4
)  There are four apps, (Store, Facebook, WhatsApp & Mail for Exchange), that you cannot delete from the Shortcut Bar
 I NEVER use these apps, so find it irritating that I can't delete them
 At least I can arrange the bar so that my frequently used shortcuts are listed first
5
)  Phone is very slick, especially the face
 The keys are slightly convex
 This combines into a less than stellar texting experience as my fingers frequently slide off
  And I feel the need to grip the phone tightly so I don't drop it
 Getting a case helped
6
) If you want to add a new contact, you can only add their number and first and last name from the add contact screen
 In order to add other information, you have to edit a contact
 In order to edit a contact, you have to go to Names, then Select that Name (which feels like you would then call that person, but you don't) which takes you to a list of options, none of which is Edit
 You then have to choose the left selection key labeled Options, then Add detail, where you can add numbers, add internet (web and email addresses), add multimedia (specify a ringtone or add an image, or add personal info (street address, birthday, note, formal name, nickname, company, & job title)
 In my Sony phone, you just had to highlight a contact name and hit edit which took you to a scroll down menu where you could edit/input info
 7
) You can't block calls from specific numbers, although you can block all calls
 8
) Menus, folders and files are not intuitive
 You can probably finally find what you want if you are willing to devote a lot of time to playing with the programming, but this might be frustrating for users who are not comfortable with technology
 9
) Useless low battery notification
 Mine notified me, (and I am being generous), maybe 3 sec before it died
 Not enough time even to say "I think my phone is going to die" before it croaked
 Sometimes, I swear, there is no notification at all
 On my old phone I had at least 30 seconds, if not longer
 Usually enough time to plug in before it died
10
) Really low ringtones and alarms/alerts
 I've only downloaded one new ringtone, (brand-new, not copied from the Sony data card), but it isn't any louder than the ones already on the phone
 I have everything set as loud as it will go, but ringtones are still almost mute
 But at least I can hear callers
 Speakerphone also low volume
 Almost, but not quite, useless
 Oddly enough, the standard tone for calendar alerts is reasonably loud
 Unfortunately, you can't choose this tone for other things
 I also tried recording loud tones through the Voice Recorder
 Still comes out almost too low to hear
 I wear the phone against my body and almost always feel or hear the vibration of a current call, so I can deal with this irritation
 Oh, and turning off your phone or putting it on Silent does not turn off alerts
 I have not yet found where you can choose to mute alarms for a period of time, like when in a theatre
 I am going to be in trouble when I am someplace quiet and a calendar alarm goes off
  11
) Battery life nowhere close to what was advertised
 I usually read/write 2-3 texts per day, have 3 daily alarms, occasional calendar reminders and talk anywhere from 1 to 3 hours per day
  My battery is then almost fully depleted
 I MUST charge every night
 As a test, I talked for an hour on a fully charged phone
 When done, I was down one of the four bars indicating battery life
 It took 54 minutes to re-charge the battery to full
 I had hoped to be able to talk about 6 hours and still use all the other functions as needed
 Not possible
 If I have a heavy texting day, the battery life plummets
 Texting just eats the battery up
 Invest in a car charger - you'll need it
 However, if you don't use the phone, you could probably get 5 - 7 days between charges
 I have recently ordered a new OEM battery
 If my experience varies from the past, I will update this review
 (Update: new battery made no difference in battery usage
 Texting still eats up the battery and I still charge every night
)12
) Phone resets itself to its default ringtone even though I copied tones from my Sony and set them as ringers for specific callers
 New ringtones are on my data card, and the phone recognizes them, but I would have to reprogram the phone every day or two to have vanity ringtones
 Life is too short
 I gave it up and just use the default
 13
) There  is no way to turn predictive text on or off forever
 You change capitalization by clicking "#" but if you click it too fast, you turn on/off predictive text
 Also, no choice for numeric only
 You choices are: "ABC, Abc or abc
" if you want to use numbers in your texts, you must press and hold the key several seconds until the number pops up
 14
)  Loses texts
 The texting feature includes being able to read whole conversations, however, don't expect it to sort your responses correctly
 I often find texts from different people in the wrong conversational folder
 Also, it randomly loses texts entirely
 I recently (11/19/14) tried to look up a text that I specifically remember getting approximately 9/23/14
 I looked through ALL my folders and this text is just gone
 15
) Several times now, the phone has "frozen" and begun vibrating and buzzing loudly
 Then no buttons work
 It has done this most frequently while listening to saved music files for a long period of time
 For instance, I downloaded some white fan noise to help me sleep when traveling
 The phone froze and buzzed several nights in a row while I slept, waking me from a sound sleep like a fire alarm
 The only way to stop it is to pry off the back and remove the battery - not something easily accomplished when you've just awakened in a panic
 I finally decided to leave the back cover off and just use the rubber case to protect the phone
 Final Analysis: if I knew then what I know now, I don't know if I would still buy this phone
 Most of the Cons are just minor annoyances but the freezing thing is pretty serious
 Makes me question the longevity of the phone
 Compared to smart phones, this phone is pretty cheap at about $85 out-of-pocket, but since I am one frugal mama, that is still expensive to me, especially if it is going to crap out after only a year or two
 I might have been better off with an older high-end feature phone - one developed before smart phones took over the market
 I seriously doubt this was engineered as well as Nokia feature phones were in the past
Update 8/28/2016: Well, I guess I have an answer to whether or not I would choose this phone again - I would
 Or at least I would if it hadn't doubled in price since I bought it
 I don't know how a discontinued "dumb" phone goes from $89 in 2014 to $199 in 2016
 That is just insane
 It isn't that great a phone
 I liked a lot of the features, like having 10 alarms, and having birthday reminders in my calendar that also told me how old the person was, but not enough to pony up $200
I am a creature of habit, but I'm also a cheap SOB
 When the Nokia literally took a nap with the fishes, I looked around for a new phone and ultimately decided I would buy another 301 - until I saw how outrageously they are now priced
 Unfortunately, I also discovered in my research that there are 3 versions of this phone, only one of which will continue working in the USA after Dec, and only Amazon is selling that version
 (Model RM-841
 This info can be found on the white label under the battery
) Rather than pay the new extortion price, I hopped over to Kroger and bought a $20 Go Phone
 Do I like it
 No
 It irritates the living daylights out of me
 But when I think about it costing only $20 - I get a whole lot happier
One last Con I discovered since I had to get a new phone: you can port a phone's worth of contacts TO the 301, but woe unto you if you need to port your contacts from the 301 to another phone
 The Go Phone necessitated a new micro sim card
 AT&T couldn't read my old mini sim, even though I could still access it thru the 301
 (Water damaged the in & out mics, but the rest of the phone works
) I had to bluetooth/slam each contact to the new phone individually: a process that took me over 4 hours
Update 9/14/2016: It took 2 weeks in industrial strength dessicant, but the 301 has been resurrected
 All functions appear to have returned to normal
 After a few weeks with the horrible Go-phone, I have upped my review to 4 stars
 I know this phone won't last forever
 I just ordered some cheap rubber port covers to try to avoid the humidity issues that almost trashed it this summer
 I know I will be forced into a smart phone sooner rather than later, but I found I definitely like this phone better than anything else I can afford right now
 (But it is still horribly overpriced at $200
)
I've had this phone for almost 2 months
 I loved it when I got it and I love it just as much today
 Nokia is so great when it comes to giving their customers what they really want
 Every time my friends can't get through to make a call with their smart phones, it's my Nokia they want to borrow
 LOVE THIS PHONE
 Tough, Dependable, Handsome, Very Clear Reception
 Good Price too

Have just started using it, but all seems to be well
 Stylish and compact

all was as advertised
 volume is very good for inexpensive unit
Its a pretty good phone for what it is
 I gave it 4 stars because of the high price I paid
 I bought this phone for my mother that doesn't have a data plan but needed a new phone that was reliable and had long battery life and didn't require a data plan
 It was a HUGE update over her old LG flip phone with less than 1 megapixel camera (LOL)
 The 3 megapixel camera is actually pretty decent, no auto focus of course

but it gets the job done and the images are pretty usable in good light
 Nothing like a smartphone today though
 This phone is really easy to read, has good bright screen that seems to be scratch resistant so far
 Has a 3
5mm headphone jack for listening to music with normal headphones and in fact, it even comes with a pair of earbuds
 My mom keeps them in her purse and listens to the radio sometimes at work
The call quality was VERY important and this exceeds my expectations
 The HD voice this supposedly has, really works
 I can finally call my mom or vice versa and actually understand what she is saying now
 Before it was so muted and broken up
The build quality is pretty good I must say, doesn't seem liked it would break if dropped
 The buttons feel good, the backlit keyboard is a nice touch
 Overall, the phone has really good looks and doesn't look like your typical basic phone
It comes with some okay apps, but most of them are only useful if you have a data plan
 There are some apps available online that you can download and install on the phone

just basic free games
My mom really wanted to get a smartphone

but the costs of adding another data plan to the line was just outrageous
 She is using AT&T, I would really love to switch to T-Mobile, but they just don't have that great of a service here in Vermont
 Maybe someday
 I contacted AT&T about this phone and they said this phone DOES NOT require a data plan
 I originally wanted to get her the Nokia Asha 501 because it has Wifi and a touch screen

but AT&T told me that its considered a smartphone BECAUSE it has Wifi and a touch screen
So this phone was a compromise and so far, she likes it
 The battery life is just incredible

stays charged well over a week
 Her old phone, she had to change probably 3 times a day
Despite the cost of this phone, it was a pretty good buy
 Hopefully someday I can get my mom on the smartphone bandwagon

I really love it, the product is excellent
Warning
 The unit I received had a charger that would not work with North American 110V outlets
 It should be noted that that this phone cannot be charged in the US even though the description indicates that it will

It's cute
 The same if a Hershey bar

I had to return this phone because it wasn't a 301
2 as advertized
 It was actually a 301
1
 My first clue was that the box had a sticker placed over the original sticker saying that it was a 301
2
 Peeled the sticker off and the sticker underneath said it was a 301
1
 Then I opened the back cover of the phone and viewed the sticker on the phone and it said 301
1
 The next thing I noticed was that the AC charger would not plug into a normal USA recepticle making it totally useless without some kind of adapter
 The next thing I tried was to put my sim card in the phone and check for service
 The phone would work in GSM mode and combo mode but not in 3G mode
 This tells me that the 3G is not for USA meaning that when AT&T stops supporting GSM and goes 3 & 4 G only, this phone will stop working
 Also, unrelated to the modle number, I could not get the blue tooth to stayed paired or reconnect to my 2015 Toyota Corolla
I gave the phone 3 stars because I liked the phone's overall quality build and speaker phone volume and ease of use
 Call quality was very good and I would have probably given it a 5 star rating if it had been the phone they advertized
 Not sure if the blue tooth was defective or if it might have worked on the 301
2

It was just what I expected and works well

The phone is of high quality and connected fine in 2G mode, but would not connect in 3G mode with my AT&T cellular service in Maryland, USA
 The reason became apparent when I discovered that the 301
1 version was sent with a non-mfg label over mfg label stating it was 301
2
 The manufacturer label (and label under battery cover - see photos) showed clearly that this was the 301
1 version, which has 900/2100 WCDMA and will not allow 3G on AT&T in the USA
 I returned it less then 2 hours after opening it since the sole reason I purchased the phone was because AT&T is dropping 2G service in my area by the end of 2016, and it seems they have already been decommissioning 2G on some towers as my coverage has gotten worse on my 2G-only cell phone
 Both sellers using Amazon fulfillment appear to be shipping the 301
1 version instead of the 301
2 version described on the product page - this is evidenced by the user reviews
 Buyer beware - this phone will not provide 3G service in the USA

This ok
Excellent
Something basic and without the bells and whistles that are sheer gimmicks for ego-ridden consumer mania

ok
I **Loved** this phone
 It was perfect for what I needed
 I received it two days ago
On day 1, after working properly for hours, the screen went to white
 I could do nothing with the phone
 After several battery pulls and reboots, I finally got it to turn on
 I thought it was a fluke, as the remainder of the day, the phone worked as promised
 Excellent excellent feature phone
Fast forward to this morning
 The phone randomly rebooted to the white screen again - except this time, I could not get it to turn back on properly
 I'm very disappointed
 I dropped it off at UPS already for a return
 After doing so, I searched online and found the "white screen" issue is a problem with this model
 :-(Again, this was a perfect feature phone for me and I wish I could've kept it
 Sadly, it had to go back

Felt pretty solid for a plastic phone too
 Volume wasn't good, must be set for battery conservation
 Set on high the rings were pathetic
 Alarms were worse, plus that volume dropped significantly after half a second
 Tried with the factory alarms, mp3s, Nokia ADTS (aac) on phone and card memory

Popped in SIM card and it started working immediately
 Next test will be Australia
 So far it's been a great, easy to use phone

i waited a long time to find one of these ,,now i'm wrapt that i found one ,, its great 


only 60 day warranty
 This phone stopped receiving signal
 Took it to AT&T and they tried exchanging the SIM card
 Still doesn't get signal
 Looks like the antenna is broken
 Only had this phone about 4 1/2 months with gentle usage
 Worst purchase from Amazon ever
 Worst return and warranty policies
 Won't buy a phone off of here again

This phone has 3g and basic email setup
 It will work with ATT (including 3g and mms)
Best part is you can take it to anywhere in the world and it will work fine
 Especially INDIA
Battery life is excellent
 It has facebook, whatsapp etc
 I have an Iphone 5 and the main reason for getting this phone was for international travel and battery life (backup phone)Also this is not the dual sim phone version
 But it has a micro SD card reader
Comes with US charger, a basic headphone with mic and all the manuals

I just use this as an awesome pay-as-you-go "Voice Phone" to supplement my work-supplied smartphone with unlimited voice/internet
 I just wanted something small and easy to slip in my pocket, because my old E51 can only hold about an hour charge after 5+ years
 For voice calls, it's great
 And the ringer gets CRAZY Loud
 I do miss ability to connect via wi-fi (because I've never tried any of the internet features)


 but I'm too cheap to burn my pay-as-you-go minutes for internet
 With internet/Bluetooth disabled, and only voice/text enabled the phone seems to hold a charge for about 24 days


 and I've talked as long as 11 hours on it before the bar got down to 1/3 to 1/4th power
 My phone generally just sits in a low-power sleep mode awaiting calls, so that might explain my highend battery life
 It beats the pants off of the "Disposable" TracPhones


 and my HTC Sensation/Blackberry/Samsug Galaxy S for voice calls and ring volume
 I can hear it from the other side of the house (Though I did set the electronic screeching of Skrillex "Boomerang" as my ring tone so it would be extremely audible
) Decent MP3 Player too
 Camera is small in MegaPixel but the seamless Panoramic Patch-View mode that stitches together pictures by connecting invisible "floating boxes" works really well
 Wish my high-end Digital Cameras did that
 I should also mention that I dropped my contracts with T-Mobile, and switched to pay-as-you-go
 I was really hesitant to do this, but on paper it saved $1000/year for my wife and I
 Now, we load about 1000 minutes every 6 months @ 100 dollars for 10 cents a minute and a 1 year expiration
 Since these are our "backup phones" for inbound calls and we my work phone with unlimited minutes


 this works perfectly
 I couldn't ask for a better Voice Phone with a simple keypad, Camera and MP3 player
 I picked this over the E52 largely because this is a new phone, and that is technology from 3 years ago which I'd have to buy from the Gray Market overseas
 I didn't figured that battery life on any new "Prior Generation Phones" (like the E51 or E52) would be dubious at best -- since and the battery would have been resting in a "New Unopened" box for so many years in a discharged state
 I'm on the Internet enough at work


 and I have my Work Phone for that
 As a great Voice/Text phone, the sound, volume and quality is perfect

I love this phone
 My previous phone was Nokia 5310 and I got this one as an upgrade recently because the buttons had cracked on my old phone
 I like that this is a simple phone (not a "smart" phone, has no touch screen, menus are easy to navigate) but has all the features I need in a phone
 The battery life is pretty good
 I don't make many calls or send many texts and I get about 3 days of battery life before I need to recharge it
 It was very easy for me to set this up with my contacts and plug into my (Windows) computer to install custom wallpapers and (MP3) ringtones
 The camera is decent, seems to take better photos than my old phone did and the camera has more settings than the camera on the 5310 did
 I have T-Mobile service and it was very easy to simply switch my SIM card to this phone from my old one
 The USB cable (Nokia model CA-101) from my old phone worked perfectly with this one to connect it to my computer and drag/drop files and photos onto this phone
 The Nokia 301 did not come with a USB cable
 This phone has the ability to check emails and such but I never use that feature (I don't have the upgraded phone service) so I can't comment on how quickly it allows you to accomplish those tasks
 My only real complaint about this phone is that it does not have full-screen photocall (like my old Nokia phone did) and it doesn't let me view photos as organized by folder from the mini SD card (just views them as if they were all in one huge folder unless you specifically save them to individual "albums" and then only view the album that contains the photo you want to view)
 Other than that, it's a great, simple mobile phone for those that are not really very tech-savvy
 It seems to be made well and I'm confident that it will last longer than my old phone did
 It is slightly larger than the Nokia 5310 and the buttons are bigger and more sturdy so they won't crack from texting a lot (like the 5310's buttons)
 I easily found a nice protective gel cover and clear screen protector film/cover for it on eBay
edit Oct 2015: I still love this phone
 I've had it a while and still holding up great
 None of the buttons got cracked at all even though I text often
 I'm still getting about three days of battery life on it (the original battery) before it needs charging but I rarely makes any calls (only daily texting)
 The gel cover (bought from "cbcelectronic" on eBay held up great and easily protected the phone from the many times I've dropped it and the screen is still like brand new as well because of the protective film
 I bought my Nokia 301 from the seller "Zezoo Store" on Amazon and it came brand new in original Nokia box
edit 2: I bought "MaGeek® 6ft micro USB to USB Cable High Speed USB 2
0 A Male to Micro B" for this phone and it is very nice quality cord that worked perfectly with this model of phone so I could transfer MP3s and photos and such between the phone and my Windows 7 computer
The phone is still holding up beautifully and I text often
 I wish they still made this model phone, as I'd readily buy another if/when it ever breaks
 I'm not a fan of "smart" phones or phones with touch screen
 My phone still has the original battery though it doesn't keep the charge as long as it used to when I first got it and I charge it about every 2 days now

Thought this might be a good basic phone, but it definitely has its shortcomings
 The construction is good, but I got a better signal on my 6-year-old Nokia 5310, and it couldn't read the music and photos on my SIM card, only the address book
 Wish I could have liked it more

First off, this is a great phone for someone who wants a simple,durable, and reliable phone
The Good:+Works with AT&T 3G and works as a VERY fast modem when you connect it to your computer
 Also works with T-Mobile, but you may not get 3G in your area, but you will get EDGE at the very least, which is more than enough when using the phone's built in browser
+Speaker is fairly loud and better than other basic Nokia's
+Camera is good and fast for a 3
2MP, also has extra features like panoramic and self-portrait
+Battery life is GREAT
 Will last 4 days easily with moderate to heavy use and probably a week or more with light use
+Build Quality
 This thing is built like a tank and the keyboard feels great
 This thing will outlast any drop, maybe even a bullet


But there are a few minor issues
The Bad:-There is no volume rocker
 You use the D-Pad when in a call, but you cannot adjust the volume when in any application
 Like web browsing or reading text messages
-No multi-tasking
 Not a big deal, but if you are in the browser or using an application like Google Maps, you cannot activate the loudspeaker unless you exit the application while still in the phone call
 Also you must exit any application/game to read a text message and reload the application/game again
Other Small Issues:=Camera has no autofocus or flashlight
=No Wi-Fi
 Not a big deal, especially if you have 3G service in your area
=Limited tethering capabilities
 You can tether to an Android device and use it as a portable modem using BlueVPN, but you will have limited capabilities
Overall, this is an amazing phone if you want a simple, elegant and durable phone
 The features are better than other basic phones and this phone is very fast
 Another Nokia phone to consider is the Nokia C2-01
 It has the same camera, but it has a smaller screen and the 3G is not as fast
 The C2-01 is a better option for those who like to tether their phone to iPods and Andoids and also for those who like to hack into their phone to customize it and add multi-tasking
5 Stars for the Nokia 301, it is truely a great phone
Edit: After using the phone with WhatsApp, it IS possible to use WhatsApp on this phone and it works quite well
 The issue is that once you start using it, the battery life drops dramatically
 You can get about 1 day of battery life, less than what I get on my smartphone
 This is quite disappointing
Some other minor issues is that although it is a GSM phone and has 3
5G
 it is only on 850/1900
 Which is fine is America, but they removed the 2100Mhz from upgrading from the C2-01
 I would recommend a C2-01 over this phone as it is a better all around phone, but slower 3G speeds
I have reduced my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars
 The fact that Nokia (or Microsoft
) has removed features from "upgrading" is a shame
 It is still a good phone, but there are betters out there
 And Nokia, PUT IN A VOLUME ROCKER


For what I need, is a very good phone
 The battery last around a week, with a 3-4 hours talking, around 15 text messages, alarm clock every day
 It feels good in hand (pretty heavy, not cheap, even though is a cheap plastic)
I don't listen music, I don't play games, I don't surf the net with the phone
 I just needed a phone that makes phone calls, has a good sound, good volume, can receive and send text messages
 This is all I need from a phone
 For the rest I have tablet and computer
What I don't like is that missing calls and messages reminder is not a feature of this phone

Fast processing, phone cell has weak performance - but that was to be expected :)Thx, Matt
best phone
it used and very bad cover it came with it 
 not worth it

if you are looking for a cell phone that is robust, has a great reception, extremely simple to use and long battery hours, this is the one
 however it has no bluetooth, or IR, and you will have to buy the cable that connects it to the pc seperatly
the camera is not high resolution, but good enough for cellphone wallpapers
 the nice feature is the side lights that keep on flashing if you receive a message or a voicemail
 the cover and the keypad can be easily changed

I got this phone as a gift for my BF



 He really loved it and I really loved it


 I put a pictrure of us together at the back


 Another nice things are the lightswhen somebody is calling or when you're talking to somebody



 So far it's been 2 months already and no complains yet from him


 or from me




 NOKIA really is the best phone out there








The phone didnot work i want a refund asap
Thank goodness


it's not as large as i thought it wold be
 VERY good reception and the volume is perfect
 So pleased with this purchase

MY MOTOROLA KRZR K1 SHORTED OUT AND I AM A BIG FAN OF FLIP AND COMPACT PHONE
 I KIND OF WANT TO BUY ANOTHER K1 BUTCANNOT USE SONGS FOR RING TONE
 SO AFTER SEARCH FOR A FLIP PHONE I DECIDED TO PICK THE 3710
 BOUGHT FOR $99 AT AMAZON WITH FREE 4GB MICROSD
 BEST PRICE ON NET
 I'M NOT A WEB OR TEXT TYPE PERSON
 AND I HAVE T MOBILE PRE-PAIDED MINUTES
 SO TO THE POINT 
 LOVE THE PHONE 
 SMALL AND COMPACT 
 THE BUTTONS ARE BIG AND HAVE A VERY GOOD TOUCH WHEN U PRESS IT
 THAT WAS MY BIGGEST WORRY AFTER CHECKING OTHER CHEAP FLIP PHONE IN STORES
 HAVE EVERYTHING I WANTED
 A CAMERA, MUSIC PLAYER, EASY TO USE, ETC
 ONLY ONE THING I HATE ABOUT THIS PHONE IS THE #$%@#ING BATTERY COVER IS A &^%* TO REMOVE AND INSTALL
 THE COVER SLIDE IN AND OUT 
 THE PROBLEM IS IT'S VERY TIGHT AND THE COVER IS SILICONE LIKE SURFACE
 TOOK ME 30 MINUTES TO REMOVE THE COVER AND REINSTALL IT
 I HAVE TO USE A DAMPER CLOTH TO GRIP THE COVER AND PRESS VERY VERY HARD
 NOKIA SHOULD JUST USE A BUTTON LATCH LIKE MY K1
 LUCKILY THIS DAMN PHONE IS BUILD EXTREMELY TOUGH
 THANK GOODNESS
 I WAS SO PISSED OFF AND AFRAID I MIGHT BREAK THIS PHONE BY SQUEEZING SO HARD ON IT
 I AM 5'10" GUY
 I WOULD HAVE GIVE IT A 5 STAR AND PLUS
 BUT THE DAMN COVER
 SO IF U ARE JUST LOOKING FOR A QUALITY FLIP PHONE, THIS IS THE BEST
 SMALL THIN COMPACT
 THIS IS IT
 ONE MORE THING MAKE SURE U READ THE MANUAL TO INSTALL THE MICROSD CARD
 U NEED TO SLIDE THE HOLDER INWARD AND IT WILL FLIP UP
 DO NOT TRY TO FLIP IT UP WITHOUT SLIDING INWARD OR U WILL BREAK IT
 HOPE THIS REVIEW HELP U 
 KEEP THE FLIP PHONE ALIVE AND WELL IN THE FUTURE

This phone is exceptional for sound and camera functions, for people that don't need the data package
 I saved $20
00 per month by eliminating the data portion and only getting the 1000 text message plan for $10
00 per month
 Camera has a flash and takes great pictures, music is really clear and sounds great
 Voice communication is really clear and one of the best phones I've had and I've had a few
 Smart phones are okay for the working people but I'm retired and only need the basics, which this phone gives you
 Price was low and phone is one of my best
 Recommend to anyone only needing text message and voice calling

If you are looking for a reliable phone that makes great quality calls, has good battery life and is reasonably-priced then this is the phone for you
It's very easy to use, nice and small and is GSM so works in Europe too
The USB cable it NOT included, which is a bit of a downside
Don't get too excited about the GPS - it's good in that it works without a data plan but it does take around 5 minutes to load and you do really need a micro SD card to store the maps
 This is never going to replace an actual GPS or Google Maps on an Iphone, but if you're not expecting it to do that then it's a nice little feature
I switched to this from the LG Renoir, which has an 8 megapixel camera, WIFI etc etc but absolutely terrible call quality and was not at all user-friendly and am very happy with the switch

This Nokia phone is an excellent basic cellphone
Stores contacts, big buttons for pressing numbers and uses the Symbian OS
Only problem I've had with this is the back cover
 It is indeed, like other reviewers claim, difficult to open
 It requires some force or some fingernails to pry off
You have to be careful not to pry it off the wrong direction incase the clips accidentally break the back cover off
The phone still works without the back cover
 (i turned it on after I switched sims just to try it out
)Other than that, sound quality of the phone is good
 People hear me clearly when i talk to them
 It has good loudspeaker, volume can go really high
It's small enough and has a solid feel to it

I love the phone
 It is simple to use, I love that you can have multiple #s associated with one name, love the touch of the key pad and the bigger display on screen if wanted

My wireless carrier is AT&T (no data plan) and I was looking for a basic compact cell phone that would sync with my office's Outlook 2007 Contacts and Calendar using a USB connection
 This phone, with Nokia's Ovi software, meets my needs
 I simply make the USB connection with my Nokia 3710, and my PC and Nokia 3170 contacts and calendar are synchronized
Summary - Compact design
 Solid construction
 Good reception and voice quality
 Synchronization of PC contacts and calendar
 Excellent value

It has a larger display than my old nokia so it's easier to see when I'm texting, good battery life, good signal strenght, a decent camera, if you're used to nokia features-they're all there & some seem improved
 The only thing I don't like is the GPS
 Amazon has all the OEM accessories at great prices as well
 Just a good basic phone I'm glad I bought it & would reccomend it, just pop in your old sim card & you're good to go

I purchased this phone to replace someone else's "free" flip phone given by AT&T (which started to have random glitches after irreversible firmware update)
 That person does not want or need any smartphone functionality, and for this purpose, this phone is a perfect replacement
 It is very compact, it works on all non-3G GSM bands (doesn't seem to be working with AT&T's 3G frequency, but that is not important for a phone like this), it has a good reception in all zones covered by AT&T and a pretty good battery life
The body has a minimal set of buttons - no silly PTT (push-to-talk) or media player dedicated buttons on outside (which tend to be pressed randomly on other models and thus require the usage of key lock function, which is annoying), just a volume up/down button on the right side
 The front display is minimalistic, but it does its function perfectly and displays all the needed info (current time or Caller ID info) using a perfectly legible and elegant-looking font
 There are 2 charger "ports" on outside, one is USB (the "micro USB" kind) and the one is the round plug which requires the (included) proprietary charger
 The phone can be charged through either of them and they are not covered by rubber "flaps", which is less "annoying" than other phones where you have to almost break your nails trying to extract the little rubber/plastic flap out of charging port
The software is also minimalistic but pretty functional, with all functions required by such phone working perfectly and easy to set up (you have to do a little bit of typing setting up MMS/WEB gateway settings for AT&T network (visit AT&T's official forums, the Nokia section, to read about necessary settings), but if you don't need these functions everything else is pretty self-explanatory and don't require any "user manual" or Google searches to set up)
 The GPS function works with AT&T's "Family Map" tracking service, though you do need to enable data usage for GPS function to be able to locate this phone's user with more precision and with shorter time, but the data usage is very insignificant and you don't have to do that if you don't use the "Family Map" service
What else


 The built-in camera works well for its intended function - obviously not as good as similar cameras on smartphones but better than majority of cameras on other non-smartphones
 Oh, and some people complained about the back cover being somewhat difficult to remove - it's true, it is initially difficult to remove it, but you can learn (after a few tries) to remove it easily, it just requires finding a right "spot" to press while pulling the cover, and the cover itself is made out of pretty flexible plastic so it is highly unlikely that you might break it (unless you are a very, very impatient person) and you don't need to remove it at all if you don't need to change your SIM card
 Overall it is one of the best non-smartphone models I have ever had pleasure dealing with and I highly recommend it if all you need is to make calls and maybe occasionally send/receive a SMS/MMS message

I had high hopes for the Nokia 3710 and did lots of research prior to purchasing the phone
 The main reason I purchased this phone is because of its quad-band versatility (I was traveling to Great Britain) and I wanted to be able to use it on my travels
 The #1 reason for my low-rating is because of the back cover
 The ONLY way I am able to even get it off is with rubber kitchen gloves and I did not have rubber kitchen gloves available to me when I was in the UK trying to put the SIM card in
 My fiance broke the prongs holding the back cover onto the phone just trying to get the thing off and now it looks ridiculous
 The camera is nice and delivers great photos, but when I am on a call and someone calls in via call-waiting, there isn't any tone or beep letting me know someone else is calling me
 I am TERRIBLY disappointed with the phone and will be looking into purchasing a different one

This is a wonderfully designed phone for people who don't have a data plan and don't want one
 It gets great reception, makes clear calls and will do texting if you so desire
 The main menu is super user friendly and it has some useful built in apps
 The GPS Maps and navigation are free and you don't have to access the wireless internet to use them
 You can download them with your home computer over your home internet connection and transfer them to the phone with the Nokia Ovi software suite
 The FM radio and MP3 player work well
 This little unlocked phone is far better than anything AT&T is currently offering for people who are not interested in accessing the internet with their cell phones
 The freedom from AT&T's locked phone software is a huge plus and greatly simplifies the phones menu navigation and ease of use
 I put in the AT&T SIM, 4 GB of extra memory and the battery and the phone fired right up
 Only minimal configuration was required to meet my particular desire to have the GPS function never access the internet and to run the network in GSM only mode to save battery life since I never access the 3G network
 If you are not technically inclined you need not do anything and you will be no worse off than AT&T's locked phone default configuration
 The setup menus are very user friendly
 I had no problem removing the back cover as some other comments suggested
 The camera is nothing special and lacks auto focus but does have a flash
 It is about equivalent in picture quality to a throw away snap shot camera
 I highly recommend this phone to any non data cell phone user

THIS IS A VERY NICE LITTLE PHONE
I LIKED THIS PHONE AND ITS FEATURES,HOWEVER
 I THOUGHT IT WAS A BIT TOO SMALL
I FOUND THAT IT APPEARS BIGGER IN THE PICTURE
THE PROBLEM I HAD WITH THIS PHONE
 I AM WITH ATT,AND IT WAS NOT ALLOWING ME TO DOWNLOAD MULTI MEDIA









It a request from a friend who wanted to have this model back in the day

Working perfectly
every thing is very goodbut i think the battery is not Originalthank you again
didn`t work with my carrier
And this fills the bill
 I bought this for use on the Redpocket (AT&T) network, and it has been excellent
 My wife did NOT want a "smartphone" and this one works perfectly for her
 That and it fits easily into the little side-pocket in her purse which is perfect
 Do NOT expect great photos, however
 They all seem to come out "muddy" on this one
 OK for quick shots but not for more important ones

The phone charge drains in 4 hours and the cover gets scratched very easily the phone looks old and scrabby in 2 weeks
The Nokia phone has been in my possession for a few years now and it is very resilient
 If you are looking for a simple dial phone that receives text messages this is the one for you
 I would strongly recommend this
 It charges in one hour and holds the charge for days

We had to return this phone because it does not have the voice dialing feature we needed
 Other than that it is a good phone

As might have been expected from a Nokia product, excellent design, comes unlocked as stated, worked in Venezuela without any problem

First - I am shocked at the $30 rise in price in just two weeks for this well-made phone from Nokia
 The only thing I can figure is this phone is not manufactured by Nokia anymore, per their web site (it's in their 'archive')
That aside, it is a great phone with excellent vocal clarity
 The built-in voice recognition is also good
 The Nokia's speed dial (unlike the LG LG230 Dimson) is able to assign different phone numbers belonging to the same person (e
g
 a speed-dial number for your wife's work and a speed-dial number for you wife's cell)
 A note regarding 'voice dialing': No need to say "call" etc
 - just say the person's name
 E
g
 "John Smith, Mobile"PROSExcepts up to 8GB microSD RAMSpeed dial number oriented (allows more than one speed-dial number per phone book entry)Works well with Bluetooth: Tested with Bluetooth Headsets Jawbone ICON and Plantronics Discovery 975FOIBLESBattery CoverAs with other evaluations, the back of this phone is (putting it mildly) DIFFICULT to remove once the battery is inserted
 I suspect the battery forcing the cover up along with the unusual hinge angle over the earphone jack as the cause of the difficulty
 I have been successful in carefully prising the cover off the phone: the but-end and then the two sides so they snap loose; then carefully raise the end to unhinge the back from around the earphone jack
 Poor design for the sake of elegance
 Hopefully, Nokia gets it right on the next flip-phone cover design - WAIT - there is no Nokia flip phone on the American market
15 October 2011 Correction to above comment regarding 'voice dialing': This phone cannot be instructed to pick one of many numbers assigned to a phone book entry - it uses the 'default' number only

I thought the seller was amazing
 The phone does not work on TMobile's frequencies in the US --- too bad, because it is a great phone --- the last Nokia flip phone --- with fantastic features
 The seller accepted it back and refunded the purchase price within days
 I could not be happier how I was treated
 If only I could have used the phone

I still love my flip-phone, it has served me well, but now I need a touchscreen so I can text easier

I love flip phones and my old one broke
 I was worried that the pink is to girly but I love the colour - I think my phone is pretty cute
 It is easy to set up
 I agree the battery is not the best, but I have had worse
 Camera is also great
 I dont use internet etc on my phone and only use it for calls and texts
 Would definetely buy it again

Came to me with perfect new clean condition

 Im from the Philippines


My sister is really rocking her new phone
excelent
bueno
Excelent smartphone
It works well for several years
NEVER GET THIS PHONE IT SUCKS, I loved my NOKIA 3500 and I thought that this phone would be great, but it wasn't and I can't believe I wasted the money on it
Great product and accessories
 It is unlocked as labeled and Im using this as my roaming phone
 This is similar to my old roaming phone (nokia xpressmusic 5220) which broke down finally ^-^ after 5 yrs of service, so I just removed my micro sd card and sim card from another country and voila
 started using this phone with no problem :)
A year ago I bought this phone for my father and has not failed at anything
 is very convenient to operate
 Nokia makes great phones definitely
I already owned this phone a while back but unfortunately it was stolen
 This is an excellent phone 4 the price
 It's main strengh, music
 Speakers are as loud as hell and excellent quality, earphones even better
 It may take a while to get used 2 the music buttons but not a problem
 For a 2mp camera photos are pretty good, but no flash though, but I can live with that
 Video is choppy though, but this is an XpressMusic, it's not its purpose
 Battery life is incredible, both for music and talking, design is slim enough and color has that cool metallic look, only wished dealer had red or black as well
 If you want a great non-Android/iPhone cell, this is the choice
Only drawback, it's imported from Africa, so you need an american charger, but u can get 1 in amazon for less than 3 bucks (Nokia AC-3U Travel Charger)

The blue color shown in the illustration is dark blue
 The phone supplied is a light sky blue
 Besides that the phone works great and is unlocked so works with any SIM from any provider

My 5140i is 8 years old
 Still works, the battery still last about 7 days
 But the cover totally desintegrated and the chinese aftermarket covers I was able to find don't last a month (the flip out rubber cover at the base the protects the ports falls off within days)
 So, since I am no fan of smart phones, and frankly there is no other rugged phone (with termometer, compass, flashlight, noise meter) that is available in Europe I was amazed to see the new 5140s on Amazon
The delivery was prompt, I got it in 4 days
The product however is a nothing short of dissappointment
 The "original" is made in Hungary, in an official Nokia factory (no longer exists I think), this one on the other hand came from Hong Kong
 Made in China
 The batteries, also chinese (two included) last for 2 days (and because the quality of assembly is dismal it doest fit properly), the bottom half (for some reson the keys have latin and hebrew letters too) of the case doesn't attach to the top half (which by the way doesn't have the level to help calibrate the compass)
My rating is 3/5, mainly because I want to give it a shot, see how long it will last
 So it's based on my love for the brand and the original product
 If I was new to this particular phone I would have given it 2 stars out of 5
The op system is slightly updated but no longer has the Polar Fitness watch support

Terrible
No comment

Hmmm I was wating very much, because my original Nokia 5230 was very good
 This copy isn't very good: the voice isn't good, the speaker isn't working always


so I'm very dissapointed

Has some scratches and wear and tear phones works fine but i got charger, sim cards and case box and manuals so not bad for the price
Has GPS like newer phones
 Was a good stop stop gap phone for me in between phones for the price as well

I try to switch my sim card to this phone but did not work at all, I cannot send messages and cannot make any calls pls help me with this issue

please don't buy it 
 not worth a doller it got broken on the first day i got it
 not worth it 
it not unlock phone 

I bought this phone here because at the time it was $30 cheaper than what T-Mobile wanted non-contract
 When I got it, I put my SIM card in
 Calling worked fine, but I couldn't get the data service to work
 After talking to many different people at T-Mobile (with several different answers), I concluded that the right answer was that the unlocked phone wasn't allowed by the network to use the data services (at least not 3G services)
 Thankfully Amazon allowed me to return this phone and T-Mobile was willing to cut their price some since I had to buy it from them and wasn't happy about it
Regarding the phone itself, it's a decent inexpensive smart phone
 I still use it today (nearly a year later)
 The screen is small compared to more expensive phones
 The touch screen actions are at times inconsistent (but you learn how to use it)
 It manages my gmail accounts nicely (though it can only be set to auto retrieve at most 2 accounts)
 You can do basic web browsing to get information you need
 You wouldn't want to use it all the time or you would go insane due to the small screen
 Speed is okay with 3G, painful with Edge (roughly equal to dial up)
 But the basic browsing capability has come in handy several times
 Also, the remote lock and wipe features are nice ever needed
The biggest drawback is the Symbian OS
 Everyone has pronounced it dead and it's tough to find apps for it
 Tons of iPhone and Android apps out there do not and never will have a Symbian equivalent
 If there were, I would use my phone more
 As it is, I use an iPod touch wherever I can get wifi and only use my phone when I can't use the iPod
To be sure it's no iPhone, but it gets the job done - if you buy it from T-Mobile

I buy this phone because in the amazon page say clearly that is unlocked
 But for my surprise when I have the phone in my hands I know it belongs to T-Mobile company and obviously is locked
 After several e-mails and the promise of OEM company that they send me the internal code to unlocked the phone, I know its only a lie because finally I receive a e-mail, saying that I will have the option of return or change the phone
 NEVER BUY ANHITHING IN THIS COMPANY, definetely its better to pay some dollars more and obtain a really new and unlocked phone
This phone comes with good excessories, however I was disappointed that i had purchased the phone as unlocked and when i recieved it it was not unlocked to fit european sim cards

Not too great product
 GPS works very slow and can't find the place often
 The touch pad works not very well too
 Not recommend

I bought this phone for two reasons:1
 It's a well-functioning phone (I like Nokias) with a touchscreen and my sister has one so I could play around with it before buying
2
 It's unlocked and doesn't cost an arm and a leg like many other unlocked phones do
I've had it for just over a month now and so far so good
 I really like it

This Nokia 5230 is a super little powerhouse of a phone
 It has all the features you would want in a phone -- excellent camera, super-fast GPS and mapping features, very large storage capacity, etc
 The only negatives are a relatively short battery life (it must be fully charged every day) and confusing offers from Nokia, charging for downloads that don't appear and which, it turns out, aren't compatible for this particular model
 But that's Nokia's doing, not Amazon's, and really, the apps I tried to add would have been fun, not necessary
 I'm very pleased with the phone and thrilled that it was unlocked
 My plan was to use this with an international carrier, but when my other phone drowned shortly after this one arrived, it was able to step in as my #1 phone
 Outstanding value

La entrega no fue a tiempo de navidad pero funciono para después de reyes
 gracias el producto llego en buena condiciones
 lo recomiendo 100%

This was my second touchscreen phone, and overall it is a great phone
 GPS is accurate if sometimes a bit slow
 Signal reception is better than any phone I have tried(AT&T Wireless)
 Before now, Motorola RAZR's & RAZR2's gave me the best signal but this one blows them away
 I mean full bars where others have 1 or 2
 My only somewhat gripe is when texting it will misspell words
 I type slow, and the correct letter expands indicating a hit, and a different letter enters in the text
 Dunno if it is just a defect in this phone or a problem with the touchscreen software, but that's why 4 stars instead of 5

I am very happy with the Nokia 5230
 I don't have a data plan and don'tuse the phone to connect to the internet
 What I like most is the incorporatedGPS
 It can be set to work as an independent GPS, without connecting to theinternet (you need to disable the AGPS: Assisted GPS)
 It is wonderful to be ableto download maps from all over the world for free
 It has been a frustratingexperience, though
 Sometimes the software claims that there are no maps on thephone or that the phone is incompatible with OVI maps
 I reinstalled the phone'ssoftware and then it worked
 Then it did it again: it claimed here were no maps on the phone,while the maps were in fact there
 You just have to keep trying
 It may be a problemwith the OVI server
 I finally managed to put all the maps I wanted and the guidancevoices and it works well
 I would not recommend the phone if it were more expensive(I paid $149)
 There is no WiFi
 One more thing: you cannot delete maps selectively:you need to delete all of them and then download new ones
 I recommend backing up thememory card to the PC after downloading the maps

I bought this cell phone on black friday and when I recived it I could not be more happier
 I tested it in all posibles ways and I am impressed with all funcionsI just love have free ovi maps for my gps and I dont have to buy it anymorethe only little thing is that no wifi included for this model but for his price was just a bargainand the best part is it works in every country with GSM network (In other words, ALL)You only can say enjoy it

Touch screen works well, great sounds, can make pretty high speaker volume on a speaker phone
GPS: does nor show correct "My location"
 However, the GPS works w/o any data service and helped me a few times on a road
 I like the feature
Negative: no Wi_Fi
 Camera: too low resolution, no good pictures
This phone is just awesome
 Hip, Stylish, with lots of options
My friends are just so jealous
 I only wish I could read on it, like Kindle books



We bought this phone to replace an identical T-Mobile phone
 Everything works fine except for the internet/GPS because it is not loaded with the T-Mobile software settings I cannot get on the web
 I have searched all over the internet and also made sure all the settings are the exact same as the old phone (it had a cracked screen after being dropped)
 However I still cannot use the internet on the new phone
 We took it to the T-Mobile store but they said they could not help us (phone not sold by T-Mobile) - Did offer a new internet package, for 20 bucks more a month that they thought would allow it to connect
*** After more research I was able to change some settings I had to change the access point name to [


] in order to get it to work
 The GPS still hasn't found me yet, maybe there is yet another change needed
 FYI - This is a differnt access point than my other Nokia Nuron (T-Mobile supplied)

This mobile phone is amazing
 for me is one of the best phones on the market
 ensure maximum product
 I recommend 100%
 Greetings from Venezuela

I've purchased Nokia5230, but am very very UPSET with this product, having ealier Nokia's brand 4 Cell Phones, so only purchased this, but am unhappy
 Product is not same as Advertised
, Free Internet not at all have to pay charges even though unlocked, what sense does it make
 Scrolling is very very slow, I think they've mailed me an Duplicate or an Damaged piece
Reputation of Nkia where does it stand, manufacturing such an outdated model with a price of $ 149
99 is unbearable



I would like to have FULL REFUND on Agreeing shall return the piece, as is not a good purchase and not a good productdo call me on +1 562 552 1362
THE PHONE IS NOT WHAT I WANT, I WAS NOT ABLE TO GET THE INTERNET, T-MOBILE TRY AND NOTHING WORKS
 I SPENT HOURS WITH THEMTRYING TO MAKE MY PHONE WORK
 I HAVE AN EXPENSIVE DEVICE THAT I CAN USE AS A CELLULAR PHONE
 MAYBE IF I CALL NOKIA I CANSOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT I DID NOT HAVE TIME TO DO THAT

I travel a lot and this is what I needed at a very reasonable price
 I never owned a smartphone before, so I must say I love it
 Its been a month and I am still getting my way around it
 For now, here are some of the pros n consThe OVI maps are preloaded
 I can find the restaurants near by or explore the area
Love the OVI store and the free appsSound quality is good

 can't get better than thisSetup Email(s)with easeBattery life is good upto 3 days, if you are not using much2 MP Camera
 Good when using during the day
Cons:No Wifi
Maps: Its a bit difficult for me to use the maps

 When I add the route and say start drive, it says correct for few mins and if you happen to drive over or under a bridge or flyover, it tries to recalculate the route
 Its not helping me much
 I downloaded the OVI suite for PC so that I can sync contacts or maps with my phone
 It is the worst, it does not even recognize my phone
 So I ended up transferring files via Bluetooth
Memory: very small
 4 GB is not enough you have to delete cache from browsing now n then
Overall, I like the look and feel of the phone
 You can't expect more for such a price

Work well with T-mobile network
 The touch response can be slow at time but overall work as expected
 Due to the lack of the real keypad, some Java games will not work on this phone
 Call quality is good and battery life is above average
 GPS will take awhile to locks into the signal
 My locations and A-GPS will required connection to the internet via your carrier data plan

The Nokia 5230 is an amazing phone

 I absolutely love it
 In my opinion our phones are extentions of us and Im at a loss for words when it comes to this phone
 It is very user friendly which I was concerned about when I purchased it but I wouldnt trade this phone for anything
 There are so many apps
 that can be downloaded to personalize it to me
 And since it is unlocked when I put my sim card in and turned it on it went straight to my carrier without any hassles

I really wanted to like this phone
 The dealbreaker is that it doesn't support 3G on Tmobile network
 It is roughly 3 times slower compared to an TM506 when downloading
 On the product page if you look carefully, it does show that 3G is not supported on Tmobile
 This should be emphasized more -- here in the US you basically have two options AT&T and Tmobile, and if you have Tmobile you are pretty much out of luck
Hotmail ActiveSync -- Exchange implementation on this phone only partly supports hotmail activesync
 After doing a software upgrade (which wasn't obvious) on the phone its hotmail email support is actually not bad
 It synchronizes 2-way with your inbox and other folders
 It also synchronizes with hotmail calendar, but only the main calendar, couldn't figure out how to synchronize with other calendars (like the birthday calendar)
 Contacts is the worst -- it didn't synchronize in my case
 I probably had a couple of hundred contacts maybe that is the reason
There is also a nokia email app that supports multiple services which has a decent interface
 I don't think it supports custom folders on hotmail though
I've read bad reviews about its touchscreen, but it is not too bad
 It is no iPhone, but given it doesn't require an expensive data plan and its price, it is certainly perfectly fine
Browser seems to be working fine
Didn't have issues with GPS locking, it was pretty reasonable
 (similar to TM506, maybe a bit slower than iPhone)I haven't tried gmail synchronization yet
It does take a bit of an effort to get all its software updated and configured
I probably would have kept this phone if I had AT&T

exellent phone
very happy and shipped on time
nice phone




nothing crazy but GOOD
Wonderfull
Just an average phone for the people that don't know much about phones

An old phone but excellent quality

This is a good and durable cell phone, though I bought this 2 years ago at $75, so I guess is a little overpriced right now, compared to all new options available on the market these days
At first the product was great, then one day I removed the charger from the phone, and the guts (inside) of the phone came out with it
 I went to AT&T and they would not stand by their product
 I was told this was my fault and not the fault of the phone or poor construction
 I threw the phone out

Not worth the money
 This a very rugged phone built for the Mexican market
 The menus and features are quirky and hard to use
 The display is not the great and games or any add ons and programs are either non-existent or hard to find
 I bought this for my wife and she has not liked it from the start
 Basically wasted money, because now I need to buy her another one

This phone same to be unlocked for any carrier and it doesnt, i try to use it with an international carrier and the phone shows that its a unvalid sim card
Pro:Please refer to [

]for a complete review of Pros of the phone
Con:1
 The sensitivity of the touch screen is not adequate
 Sometimes, you need to put much force on it
 Moreover the scrolling is not easy
 It is common while scrolling, you double click on something by mistake
2
 The phone is greed to use up the battery's energy
 For instance, if you only use music player for about 4 hours, then the phone's battery will decharged within the next 24 hours during which the phone is actually in stand by and everything is off
 Besides, the actual standby time of the battery is not 432 hrs as it is advertised, but about 200 hrs, not more
 Considering this issues, what's the use of all the functionalities of the phone when you should turn them all off to save battery energy
3
 The alarm is a devil
 You cannot set the alarm's volume to the level you desire
 I contacted Nokia customer service concerning this issue and they suggested that I use a tone with a low voice
 Although, this answer does not solve the problem in general, I examined that and noticed a bug of the phone's firmware
 I reduced the amplitude of my favorite tone to 10%
 When I set the alarm tone to this one, I understand that this is not a simple problem
 Because, the phone, when starts to alarm, the volume increases from that 10% to as much as the phone can make noise
 The next time I checked with 2% tone
 No use
 Really silly, because the increasing state of tone has no upper threshold
4
 The design for SIM card and RAM places are kinda trouble
 In the package there is nothing help you to bring out the SIM card
 And RAM won't come out easily
5
 No wifi6
 The one I bought, has a Chinese RAM
 While transferring data to the RAM, it sometimes goes crazy and prevent data transferring
 It doesn't matter how you this
 I tried that via both the phone's usb connection and a seperate RAM-reader usb connection
 Well, I cannot expect more from Chinese products
Overall, if you seek some mobile phone with such functionalities offered by this phone, don't waste your money on this
 Instead buy some more expensive but reliable one

I have to say that this phone is an excellent value in every aspect
 It has any feature you could want except wifi but this phone is NOT considered a smartphone by AT&T so you DO NOT HAVE TO PAY THE $30 DATA PLAN FEE and you can use the $10 per month unlimited data

 I bought this phone for my husband because it seemed like the best alternative to an iPhone and similar touchscreen smartphones without the issue of having to pay the ridiculous "Smartphone Plan" fee
 The camera works great even though it has no flash
 You just set it to night mode and can get a better picture in low light settings
 The internal data is plenty generous and you can also add an SD card for more memory
 My husband particularly likes this because it means he can use it just like an iPod or any other MP3 player and it also has the built in radio so he can listen to it while at work (he is a residential/commercial remodeler) if he doesn't want to listen to his stored music
 You can still answer calls right from the earbuds while using the radio feature
 The touch screen is great, the screen size is great
 It has fast response time from input or touch
 We have absolutely no complaints at all
Some people might not like the idea of not having wifi, but if you think about it, if you buy any similar phone you're going to have to pay the stupid $30 extra monthly fee even if you do not use AT&T internet
 With this phone you can just get the $10 unlimited data plan and be done with it
 The internet works great on this phone and is fast in our experience
 Very happy with the purchase and the price is amazing
 Call quality is great as with all Nokias
 No issues whatsoever and highly recommended

It's pretty good so far
 Was hoping for a more automated currency converter though
 That would be good
for a modern tech savvy person this would be a very basic phone
 i own motorola droid, but i bought this one for my upcoming european trip, as i needed unlocked GSM phone
 a note: it's not the same touch-screen technology as most of modern phones use
 it's more like "point and push" which is a lot less responsive but decent
 do not get this phone if you have big hands
+ intuitive interface super easy to use+good for a touch-screen beginner (hybrid between traditional and modern selective methods)+superfast camera+nice video quality+decent display+very light and compact, good design+comes with a pick for small objects on the screen (awesome)-not a very responsive touch-screen-image quality is sub-par-no flash ( are u serious
)-maps application is not a good one-on-screen keyboard is painfulBottom line: good for someone who wants a compact easy to use phone without any advanced feature that smart-phones offer
 for everyone else: (i agree with one previous reviewer) why not get an iphone or android based phone for the same price
it works great in costa rica
 i just put the sim card in and it worked just fine
 i had a gsm sim card, but i upgraded the same sim card at the kolbi's ice celular office, it took them 3 minutes, i kept the same number and sim card and the phone its great
 i love the nokia ovi store, many free application that work down here as well
 its just a cool phone, i get clear and fluent reception everywhere i go including internet
 overall, it was a smart and cheap purchase


 if u like it, dont doubt it, go for it



I bought this phone because it was offered as a 3G 850/900/1900/2100 HSDPA capable unit
 IT IS NOT


 Even the user manual mentions it is just 900/2100 so it doesn't work in 3/3,5G with my cel company
 I have to do with Edge which is not bad but not the high speed one is used with real 3G
 Otherwise the phone is very very nice and good (like it more than the N97 although does far less things)
 I could have kept my old unit which had Edge capabilities
 Pls Amazon pls: correct your wrong description at the soonest (AND READ THE MANUAL)
 Maybe this is not the only wrong one, Buyers BEWARE
DANGER



I love this phone



 it may not be an Iphone or a droid but i love it


im not constantly on the internet but I do use it and so its great that the data plan is only $10


would definitely recommend



Nokia had many GREAT phones in the past but this one is just POOR
 I had many Nokia phones before and they all had great usability
 The Nokia 5230 Nuron, however, makes me very disappointed
 I *rarely* refer to user's manual for electronic gadgets but this one got me
 I work as a User Interface Designer and I consider myself pretty techie
 I struggled a lot when I use the phone
 Thought maybe it was my problem
 No
 Gave it to another coworker to test it and he also got stuck on entering the most basic: Contacts
1
 I spent 30 minutes trying to figure out how to use QWERTY to enter my contacts
 I had the Alphanumeric keypad up and I tried to find how to turn the QWERTY on
 Click on the icon that looks like a keyboard
 And they trick you
 A dropdown comes up and it only has 'Handwriting' and 'Alphanumeric keypad' on it
 No QWERTY
 I tried turning the phone horizontally
 Nothing changed
 Little did I know I had to turn the phone "anti-clockwise" to trigger the QWERTY keyboard to come up
 If you turn it the other way it won't work
 Fine
 Now I learned
 But that keyboard icon just totally got me
 If a keyboard can't be turned on from there, then don't make the icon looks like a keyboard for goodness sake
2
 The MAP interaction is unintuitive
 I have the phone for 2 days already and I'm still trying to figure out how to use it properly
 First of all, who would use a SmartPhone MAP for the sake of looking at it these days
 Its main purpose should be for user to "get directions" to a place
 Not for the Nuron
 I open the MAP and I don't know what to do
 I see an "Options" button
 I click on it and was hoping to see a "Go to place" link
 No
 Instead I see a bunch of useless links
 The MOST important link isn't there
 Then there's a "Search" button
 EVERYTIME I click on it, I keep forgetting that I have to ERASE everything I typed in before in order to enter new entry
 OH and to make it worse, you have to repeat that for 3 total fields (ZIP code, Street Name, Street Number
) (Why not combine Street Number and Street Name



) Then you have to click 'Options' again to hit 'Search'
 Then it tells you how many miles afar


 (I didn't know that the number of miles is THAT important
 It's the first thing I need to know
 I DON'T CARE


) THEN you click that Address again (took me awhile to figure that out) to hit 'Drive to'
 Took me 30 minutes to find that out
3
 EVERY time after I put in the battery and switch it on, it resets the Date/Time/Country
 You have to reenter EVERYTHING again
 Shouldn't a SmartPhone be able to detect where you are and the timezone

Many more but I don't want to go into it
Bottom line, with this kind of price ($165)
 Go for the iPhone

This phone over all comes in at about a B-
 The phone itself is great, excellent reception, sound and call quality
 The interface isn't bad
 People who cut down Symbian typically never gave it a chance, or used it
 It is a FINE interface for just about everything you would need to do
 It doesn't look as cool as the newer DROID or iPhone GUI, however look at the price compared to them, and you don't have to sell your soul to AT&T or T-Mo
 Battery is OK
 Email support is better than before
 OVI Maps is really good for navigation, not so good for finding points of interest
 I would recommend Google Maps as a back up for finding Points of Interest, getting that address, then putting them into OVI Maps and use it's navigation

My order was for a black Nokia 5230
 I got a white one
 I kept it cause it looks good but my order was black which was shown correctly on my order sent to my mail
 Unfortunately suddenly the order copy was changed to phone color white without any explanation from Amazon or the seller
 I wish somebody told me the color switch
Amazons follow ups should originate from the seller
 Im not sure I want to take the risk of another order being switched without my approval

Terrible phone
 Terrible reception
 Simply does not work
Phone language not stated - only get British English for English language
 Otherwise delivered on time
 Box wasn't pristine, but contents were undamaged and appeared OEM

I've used this same model of phone before, it's not a smart phone but I like it because it's small and light
 This time I order two Nokia 5310, one for me and one for my wife, the red one for my wife is okay but my black one is really bad, the battery can last only one day while it should last about 3 days according to my normal use
 The worst about this phone is the listening volume, it's so low that at first I thought I suddenly had hearing problem, then I try my wife's red phone (same model bought at the same time), I knew that the problem isn't my ear but the phone
 When the phone arrived I notice there's dust inside the screen, so I suspect it's a rejected one, but the seller sold it to me as a 'brand new' one, I paid for it at a 'brand new price'
just what i expected, minor problems tho, will sort out same in time since i use no other phone but this 4 years, thanks
It is the best choice for the kind of dirty work I am doing
 Easy to clean, easy to use, very good function under tough job site conditions
 I had this phone before and I didn't know where to get it again
 I tried some differents phone in between
 I am happy that I found it again
 So far so good after dropping it already a few times
 Very good phone for everybody who doesn't want or need a smart phone

I would have ordered more of these phones from them if they had really been new
 And I know it's not new because I got one of these phones when they first came out
 And their was a lot more stuff in the box
 And the battery in the phone would not hold a charge thank God I still have the other phone, and I put it in the phone to see if it would work and that old battery works like a charm
 SAVE




 so I'm going to keep the phone But I will find a new seller to see if I actually get a new phone this time

Although not a "smart phone" this compact device is feature-packed with a camera for stills and video, a real music player, a real FM radio using your headset as its antenna, Bluetooth and USB, and data storage on a mini SD card
 Of course, it also has the essential calendar and phone book, but they, too are feature-packed
 And, oh, yeah, the call clarity is great
 Software can be downloaded for easily backing up the phone and working on the calendar and phone book
 The best feature is that it is small
 It is a phone for those of us who have other means to get online when we need to

Small in size, sufficient to fulfill all I need from a phone (basicall a cell phone and a camera), this is the fourth Nokia 5310 I have bought: one lost, another savaged by the dog, and one needing repairs, awaiting spare parts; I must be pleased with it 

As soon as I got the phone, I noticed three items (USB cable, headset & microSD card) were missing
 I tried to reach the vendor, called more than three times, wrote more than three emails
 Never got any reply
 Not only items were missing, but the phone itself feels a used phone with the outside cover replaced
 My advice: DO NOT BUY any thing from the OEM shop



This item is a refurbished machine
 The colour of this item I purchased is different with the colour of item in the picture

really like the phone, the camera is great and the music player is even better
I have purchased this product in april '09 and so far I am impressed with it
 Being a nokia phone user for years, I am well accustomed to the features and interface even with some technological changes (like touch screen)
 The features you will read here are just some of the highlights I think is usually overlooked but as important when using cell phones
Pros:Data management
 An example is for contacts
 You can easily select and transfer phone numbers to and from the sim card
 This is a must when upgrading to a different phone without bothering to use a computer
 Try that with a blackberry pearl you will see what I mean
Unlocked
 You can use most gsm sim cards from around the globe
 (hint get prepaid sims available in most major cities) And this option is a lot cheaper than having to pay international roaming charges
 Another plus is that you are not tied to a network so you can switch whenever you like
Price
 I think this is one of the cheaper phones which has touch screen capabilities without having a contract (of 2 years usually) and no data plan required
 This was 350 USD when I bought it and has gone down to 300 (as nokia is trying to put out a newer model)Cons:As with other reviews, the plastic battery cover needs to be a lot sturdier
 It bends easily as it is made of softer plastic (maybe to prevent it from cracking or becoming brittle
)Thicker dimensions
 Not as sleek as an iphone as it is NOT an iphone
Apps for it is still limited, but expect it to grow over the years

This has to be the best phone that i have ever had
 For a long time it seemed like Nokia was getting left behind, but they have steped up their game
 I wanted a new phone and i was going to get an iphone but then i saw this and how much the iphone fanboys hate it (LOL)
 Im glad i got the nokia 5800, i got all the good things the iphone has and more
Pros:1
 great battery life
2
 wonderful screen
3
 lots of options
4
 lots of apps u can get for it
5
 flash works with it
6
 text, pic, and video messaging
7
 3
2mp camera
8
 perfect call quality
 (at least on at&t)Cons:1
 the only one i could really find, was that the touch was a little to sensitive at first
 that was soon fixed just by tweaking the settings
Overall this is a must buy for those people that want a smart phone with out changing your plan
 This phone has plenty of room to grow with updates and new apps that u can get from the OVI store and 3rd party

This phone is good, very good even, with a good set of features (Wifi, GPS, good music mgmt, video, etc) and nice touchscreen
 However, don't think that this touchscreen is even close to the iphone's
The main problem, though, is the software used to sync the phone with the computer
 It's absolutely useless
 Just look it up on the internet, you'll see lots of complaints
 It's just silly that Nokia can't get this right
 I realize it's probably Vista's fault, but still I think it's Nokia that should adapt
 The funny thing is that the previous versions of the software used on the E71, for example, works perfectly
I think if you are a big music fan and you have the patience the get to know this phone and set it up, it's very good
 If you are looking for something easy to use and your main thing is the touchscreen maybe you should look for another phone

Good phone with some nice options
 Nice touch screen, FM radio, GPS, Music player, cable to connect to PC to add Apps and games easily
 Camera is OK, but not expecting much in a cell phone
 Hopefully in the future manufacturers will address the camera quality since generally you carry this device everywhere

I recently bought this device to upgrade from the Nokia N81 8gb, and so far I don't regret my decision
What I like about this 5800 Xpressmusic:1
- It has great reception2
- It is light (lighter than N81)3
- The big screen is nice, sensitive and requires zero calibration (not like the Palm TX I used to have some years ago)4
- The sound is even better than the one in the N815
- The Internet experience flows very well, you can even watch videos from youtube right from their website6
- GPS


 mixed feelings tough, nice to have one, hard to master it, weak reception7
- The menus are very easy to get used to, very well organized, and you can still change their order or create folders to your own preference
8
- You have 4 different options for writing, from handwriting, to large full qwerty keyboard in the touch screen9
-The accelerometer works very well on directing the screen for vertical or horizontal display
10
- It comes with a micro SD 8gb (reads up to 16gb cards)11
- The PC Suite works great for sync with PC12
- Good to have a 3
2 megapixel camera (although I would only use it for emergencies, since the quality of small sensors is on the very low side)13
- Nice calendar, helps keep up with duties (although I would like some color code for different activities or meetings, something I liked from the Palm TX -although this is not the strength of this device, it is music, so well forget what I just said


)On the weaker side,1
- You cannot see the phone number of any of your contacts when you have dialed it
 You have to enter in the full contact menu to see the phone number
(Still a defect also found in N81, you have to enter in the contacts to do that)2
- GPS has very low reception, so even a tinted window of the car can block the signal3
- Battery life does not seem to last as much as Nokia claims
4
- I miss the 4 way button from N81 (HTC has one for their touch screen models too) This is especially useful to scroll over long pages such as contact lists, moving among missing calls, or just navigating the internet, where if you touch the screen you can easily activate a link
5
- Plastic feels like the shell of an egg (but I guess that's the only way to get small but technologically complex devices)6
- Does not come with protective plastic for the screen (the N81 came with an excellent one from factory)7
- Terrible image organizer and editing
 In N81, you could make albums, navigate over the photos and edit them in few steps, but now, the 5800 does not offer you the album option, you can make a folder and put the photos in, but if you want to rotate them you can quickly do it but won't save the image like that, you need to go the edit to change it, which involves 4 or 5 steps, and once you save it, it takes the image out of the folder you put it in

8
- I am not into gaming, but the touchscreen games are like for kinder kids, forget about the great engage
So then, why is that I am giving this hot toy 3 1/2 stars
Because it is still dragging some few defects coming from the N81, and considering that I am reviewing a cell phone, beyond the nice extras, after all


The calling experience might not be so fluent


When you call someone, you cannot see their phone number if you need it quickly
 I have to go back over the more than 600 contacts to find the phone number I just called


 those of you who have a Nokia know how this can bother big time


 (based on the same Symbian platform as N81)You can press the green call for starting a conversation or you can touch a button in the screen to do the same, so why to duplicate
 Same for ending a phone call
The missing 4 way button (from N81) would have been great to navigate the nice extras of the phone without "aiming" well with the tip of your finger
 But hey, N97 is coming, for a difference of price too
Overall, I recommend (barely) this cell phone, great reception (although this might depend on your service provider), fantastic sound, fluent Internet experience, excellent extras, outstanding screen and resolution, perfectly calibrated
UPDATE June 17, 2009
Cons


 Regarding webmail



1
- If you are answering a message on the webmail (Yahoo, Hotmail, Gmail, etc) say you wrote a paragraph of 10 lines and you need to add something to the 4th line of the paragraph, you CANNOT place the cursor in between, you have to delete all previous 6 lines to get to the position where you can edit your response
 Now, if you don't mind that it is fine, I tend to review what I write and often add or rewrite an idea
2
- Since you cannot place the cursor wherever you want to to write webmail, if you are answering an email and you want to include the original senders message (what is normal) your message will start at the end and not the beginning (as normal) In order to start at the beginning you would have to delete the sender's original message
Regarding crashing


3
- In several occasions it has crashed, meaning that you hung-up a call and freezes, the solution is take the battery off and put it back
4
- In several occasions when you are browsing the web and touch the middle of the screen it closes the browser and disconnects


 anyone with that problem
 I has happened to me 1 in every 10 times or so
I am starting to think that Nokia could read my review to consider these annoying issues on future updates
 :))
I have had this phone almost a month now and I am still discovering its versatility
 It is well worth the cost and does everything I wanted it to do
 I have AT&T as my provider and receive a strong 3
5g signal
 The phone is light, fits well in the hand and the touch screen is beautifully clear and responds well with the stylus
 The reception/sound quality is crystal clear, also
 The volume range is very good and the stereo speakers work surprisingly well
 The FM radio is a nice addition and I find I use it more than I thought I would
 The MP3 player is good; however, their is one thing to note about the Nokia software you use for transferring the files from your computer
 It offers an option to reduce the file size prior to downloading the music to the phone but it seems to greatly reduce the sound quality of the tracks, so I no longer use it
 The wifi/browser works fine and the zoom option helps to make all print readable
 The camera produces excellent photos but do not rely on the auto mode to give you the best shots
 The manual options have proven to allow for much better quality results so it is best to become familiar with them
 This is true with the video recorder, too
 For example, indoors on auto mode the video recording is very grainy but when using low light option the results are great


In fact, better then I had expected
 The video player was a little disappointing because seems with most of the movie files I have played so far there is some drag periodically which is irritating, especially right after the video has started
 I wonder if a more powerful processor is needed or just a firmware update would solve the problem
 Despite this I still give the phone a 5 star because it excels in every other regard
 And finally, I downloaded the free flashlight software I found on the internet and now this phone can be used as a bright flashlight for times when I need to find something in the dark
 I am waiting for a DivX player software for this version of Symbian (which Samsung offers for their phones using the same Symbian operating system) so I can play this popular movie format
When I received the phone I noticed there were 2 tiny scratches on the screen (one was deep), which I couldn't notice until I was outside with the direct sunlight reflecting off the screen
 So inspect the phone carefully right away for that or for any other defects
 Amazon customer service offered to replace the phone but I didn't want to wait for a new one to arrive
 I just wanted to mention it so you know that if you do find there is a problem Amazon is very good about offering support

I have bought this phone few days ago and I must say that this phone has everything you need
Main advantage over the iPhone
- You pay the price once and no need to worry about contracts
 It's unlock phone





- No data plan required like iPhone
- Replacable battery
This phone is very user friendly and simple to use
 So far I haven't had any trouble using this phone

I bought this item and item was bad and i exchanged it but that was too bad
So i think that stock was bad

I really enjoy this cell phone
I was expecting a lot, but it surprised me

This is an excellent smartphone that my son is completely happy with after 3 weeks of use
 He was able to insert the SIM card from his old phone and everything was recognized, and he also transferred all his music files easily to this device
The touchscreen is fantastic, and there are many useful apps available for download
 Good sound, a GPS, web access - it's all there
 Even the phone call sound quality is clear
 (imagine that
)Still, it's overpriced, - but worth buying if you want a great product and good quality

TENGO ESTE CELULAR DESDE ENERO 2010 Y SE PORTADO EXCELENTE, TIENE TODO LO NECESARIO Y MAS, CAMARA, APLICACIONES, SEÑAL,TODO MUY BIEN
 LO RECOMIENDO

Phone features are very nice
 However after a few months, it started to shutdown without warning (battery was charged) and sometimes, when this happens, it would erase the entire contents
 I've contacted amazon's customer service several days ago asking what I should do, and did not receive any replies
 Despite the fact that this is a nice phone, it's better to buy a more sturdy one
UPDATE: I've contacted Nokia USA which confirmed the phone is under warranty and asked to ship the phone to be serviced
 They returned the phone with the same problem
 I contacted their customer service and they asked to send the phone again
 Waiting for the outcome, hopefully the phone will be really fixed this time

It is one of the best telephones that I have had
The tactil screen facilitates his managing
 It is an equipment to enjoy

OK
 To start, this phone was great
 Everything worked as advertised and I just loved it
 I bought this in August of 2009 and in July of 2010 it just started rebooting on its own
 Then in September of 2010 it progressed to just shutting down
 Then when I was able to finally get it back up, low and behold no service
 Took the sim card out and put in a GO phone and I had plenty of service
 All the other features still worked fine but no service
 I guess the antenna is shot
 Very dissapointed in the fact that I paid over $300 for this and had to resort to a $29 GO phone to make phone calls
 All I have now is very expensive MP3 player
 No more Nokias for me

Great phone, had fun with it, ended up selling it for an iphone, gotta have the apps
 :)3 out of 5 stars from me
Does not come with 8 Gyga card, stead 4 Gyga
 Careful for the same price one can buy the C6 which is much better
 I discovered it one day after I bought but the return fees from the seller would make it 50 U$ more expensive, so I decided to keep it

I bought this phone thinking that it was one of the best phones but after three months it started to heat and the battery lost all his energy
 Now I have to pay a lot of money in order to fix it
 I'm from other country then for me it's more difficult to send it to the seller

after almost 3 months, no complaints so far and can't beat the price
 love it

i have had this phone for about 4 months and is great u have everything u need on it, u also can download vey useful aplications so is like a little pc, very good price for than amazing phone
The Nokia 5800 XPressMusic is smart, with good quality and complete
Notable are the Carl Zeiss Camera, GPS Navigation capability andultra-fast EDGE Internet connection
 No complaints about thiswonderful product, only (maybe) more MPixels in the Camera and alittle more precision in the touch-screen response
Is one of the cheapest middle-high-range touchscreen smartphones
And with the excellence of the Nokia brand


I will recommend it a 100%

The phone was in a good condition and seemed to be brand new
 My brother-in-law is using the phone and is very happy on receiving it because he has been waiting 4 this phone ever since his old nokia 5800 xpressmusic broke down
 Thank you Amazon
com and CLC Wholesale for delivering the phone on time

Excelente la calidad del producto, exactamente el que queria, fueron responsables en la entrega del mismo, los recomiendo a comprar porque estoy satisfecha con la compra
For a first "smart phone" it's okay
Little too thick, but it's an old model
Nokia OS it's crap and slow
 Small keyboard
Signal is great, internet navigation kind of crapy

The GPS takes like 30-40 min to detect position
 I searched online for this problem and several forums talk about it, there seems to be no way round
 The integration with Microsoft Exchange is very bad: the calendar has a limit of entries it can load, after that the phone freezes when you open the calendar, and I need to disconnect the battery to turn it off
 I tried everything, I really needed that calendar integration
 I can't use it anymore, even after resetting the phone to factory defaults and erasing everything
 To sync with exchange, it asks me every time if I want to accept the certificate
 I click on "accept the certificate and never ask again"
 It shows a message saying that next time won't ask to accept certificate
 But it keeps asking to accept the certificate
 Doesn't sync anymore unless I ask the phone to do so
 The email client for Gmail and other POP3 stopped working after some update, and I gave up on it
 Nokia released a new version of Ovi maps, and my phone updated to it, but this the new version is too heavy for this phone
 Every time after I enter the code to unlock the phone, it shows a stupid message that says that the phone has been unlocked, only to make me wait
 If you're in a meeting and the alarm starts ringing, you need to enter the code to unlock the phone before turning it off, what I do instead is to take the battery off
 Any time the phone starts making a sound it's quicker to take the battery off than trying anything else
 The web browser asks if you want to see the secure/non secure elements several times per page
 Processing power is limited and you will see that when trying to scroll in a webpage

I ordered this phone because I had an older model XpressMusic phone and loved it
 This phone has taken me some time to get use to, but over all I really like it
 I love that I can use the touch screen without taking off my gloves or just use my fingernail
 I also love the hand writing option and the alphanumeric options for texting as well as the full keyboard
 I still text faster the ol'school way using the predictive text and the alphanumeric pad
 I don't like that some of the basic features that were on my older version are not on the newer model, for example the cooking timer and the most recently used contacts option for texting
 I also don't like the alarm clock
 It works fine, but the old one didn't vibrate for the alarm and this one does
 It vibrates right off the night stand and scares me every morning
 So, I have created a special ringing profile so that it doesn't vibrate at all
 I just have to remember to switch to that profile before going to sleep
 Also, since this is my first internet type phone, I have to charge it twice as often than my old one, but I am told that is normal
All in all, I am still learning my new phone, but I like it

No reason to say about its features, it is more than known and published everywhere on internet, it is simply great
 I specially like its pop-up multimedia player menu
A bit of deception because finding applications to it is not as easy as for Android (this runs Symbian), but these do not make me think it is a bad choice
 And, of course, no other brand makes as good antenna as Nokia does, Nokia rules signal

I bought this phone based on the many positive reviews here
 I don't have a 3G plan, so I was very attracted to the GPS navigation that works without it, and WiFi connectivity
 But I have been completely disappointed with this phone
 Here's my take
Pros====-Good camera for a cellphone: 3
2 MP with LED flash
-GPS navigation works without 3G plan (at least in theory)
-WiFi connectivity lets you get online without 3G plan
-Decent battery life: usually goes a few days per charge
 It helps that I never use any smart phone features because they're such a PITA
)-Good network reception (at least compared to my ancient Motorola V188)
-Nokia is regularly updating their Ovi Suite software
 Maybe they'll fix this stuff someday
Cons====-BUGGY OS and apps
 Web browser and GPS navigation are virtually unusable
-HORRIBLE user interface all around
 Doing anything other than making calls is simply not worth the trouble on this phone
 Plan on using the stylus a lot
-GPS takes too long to get position fix
 Very spotty GPS reception inside vehicles, where you need it the most
 Despite downloading latest maps, navigation consistently gives WRONG directions
-Screen is difficult to read in bright light
 Auto brightness control does not seem to work correctly
-Confusing WiFi setup
-Only 4 shortcuts allowed on home screen, even though there's plenty of room for more
-Included USB cable is only 7 inches long
 Really


-Software updates from the phone did not work out of the box
 I had to hunt down some obscure server settings to check for updates
 You can also update through Ovi Suite on your PC
)-Accompanying Ovi Suite PC software is bloated and buggy, although they have been making improvements recently
-Included 4 GB MicroSD card is probably not enough for all your maps and music
-No letters shown on dialing pad
Bottom Line===========NOT recommended

one year of fun

 n the screen cracked while in my pocket

 they ask 150 bucks to repair it

 for a phone worth 275 almost 15 months ago

 who would repair this brick now


 not much impressed with nokia any more


A little sluggish and you usually have to reset it in order to became usable
 Freeze sometimes



I think Nokia should replace Symbian OS by Android OS
The good - GPS with turn-by-turn navigation
 Good sound quality
The bad - sluggish, poor memory, freeze, OS

I think its a great phone, call quailty excellent
 Speakerphone very good, yes OVI is a nightmare but overall a good quailty and fun phone, touch screen is a little hard but not bad
I bought this nokia phone for my son as a birthday gift last September for $299 through Amazon
 He only started using the phone on Oct 16, 2009 and within 2 mths (mid December)it suddenly stopped working
 The phone was left to charge overnight and by the next morning, there was no display
The phone was advertised as carrying a limited warranty and so I emailed Amazon's customer Service to get some recourse
 The Amazon assistance was as follows:"I'm sorry to hear your Nokia 5800 XpressMusic Unlocked Phone with U
S
 3G, 3
2 MP Camera, GPS, Wi-Fi, and 8 GB MicroSD Card--U
S
 Version with Warranty (Black) didn't work out
 Because more than 30 days have passed since you received this item, we can no longer accept a return
""I'd recommend consulting your owner's manual and/or contacting the manufacturer to see if the problem in question is covered by the manufacturer's warranty
"Amazon further advised that I could seek assistance by emailing [


], which I did on January 5, 2010
 Two months later, I am stll awaiting a response
Bottom Line : This is a faulty product with a useless warranty - a waste of $299



I have owned this phone for a few months now and it generally works OK
 I like the touch screen system and the screen resolution is good
 the screen size is nice and large so you can clearly see whats happening
 It comes with a memory card with sufficient capacity (7
6GB) for my needs
 I have also used the WiFi capability to surf internet via wireless networks and it works fine
Unfortunately there are a few things I do not like:1) The phones battery life is poor and unpredictable


-even after you shut off Bluetooth and wireless scanning
2) Nokia ovi stopped working all of a sudden
3) The phone's volume is very low (Xpressmusic

)
 I could use my previous phone as an alarm but not this one
4) Forget about trying to take photos in less than perfect lighting- they will look grainy
5) The GPS works -but it takes rather long to get a position and the altitude accuracy is always terrible
6) if you access the touch screen dialer from main menu- you only get a numeric keypad not an alphanumeric (normal) one

Compared to iPhone, this phone is really difficult to use
 Web browser doesn't support Asian languages
 There is no firmware update to fix this problem

works practically anywhere in the world
works great for any operator in my country (Colombia)
Sometimes when you receive a call, the phone enters lock state 
turn off the phone, and the phone works again
The design of this phone is sober and elegant, providing some services such as wi-fi, radio, camera, web browser, audio recorder and calls recorder are wonderful
the sound quality that has this phone is amazing
the touch screen is not as fast as an iPhone, but everything is compensated for all services that does not carry the iPhone, I'm really happy with my purchase and the truth I do not change my Nokia 5800 with iPhone neverThe flash of the camera is really strong,The design is ergonomic and fits comfortably in your hand
talk about the storage capacity the nokia 5800 is actually far superior than the iphone, because the power to insert memory the 8 gb or 16gb gives you the advantage of bringing a lot of information in your hand 





 Nokia is Nokia
two weeks ago i had this phone
 everything works perfectly except for the batterie, it dies so quick
 I really don't know about the gps and donwload videos yet
 there was the phone case and tv out cable missing in the box
 So many free games and applications to download from ovi store and too many applications slow the phone
 I hope this review help






Nokia 5800 XpressMusic Unlocked Phone with U
S
 3G, GPS with Free Voice Navigation, Wi-Fi, and 8 GB MicroSD Card--U
S
 Version with Warranty (Black)This is a very good cell phone, it has all the great features one might be looking for, the screen is really large with high resolution
 The built-in stereo speakers deliver crystal clear sound
 The only thing I kinda dislike about it is the camera, because even though it has a 3
2MP camera with its flash and everything, pictures in dark places come out with bad quality most of the times
 But besides that, I love the phone

all the equipment that you need in a single packagesometimes turns slowly when exiting applications but still rocks
This is a superb phone if you have AT&T, it does not support T-Mobile's 3G Network (only EDGE which is today surprisingly good) if it did I would give it 5 stars
 Easy interface, intuitive, navigation works, many applications from Nokia's Ovi Store, e-mail is a bit complicated but works, you need to figure out on your own though how to update its firmware, it has many improvements over the original release from Nokia
 The camera is good (not great) and I love the music library interface, comes with a free 8 GB Micro SD card

I am about to travel to Europe
 So, I did research for couple days on internet
 What I need is a smart phone with a real GPS, instead of A-GPS that requires a data plan (most of US data plans become horribly expensive in Europe)
I selected this phone with real GPS, free map, free navigation, touch screen, sliding fingers on screen, 3
2 pixel camera/video, zoom, flashlight, red eye reduction, and etc like an iPhone without data plan
 It also has voice commands





When I got this phone, it is really excellent
 GPS works and Map also works great
 But, when I tried navigation, it fails
 No matter how many times I followed instructions on Nokia (and Ovi Map) web site to reinstall Ovi Map, navigation simply won't work
 I spent couple hours digging through users' postings on Nokia's support web site
 Finally figure out that the old map application #3
01# on the phone must be first uninstalled
 Otherwise, the newly installed Map 3
03 #246# won't work, despite it always reports the installation succeeds
 See "Re: unable to install ovi maps 3
03 on 5800XM" posted by Gilles on [


]I almost return this phone becuase it fails deliver the navigation function
 If you read users' posts on Nokia's support site, you will reallize that tons of poeple have the same problem
 I think Nokia better updates its web site ASAP
 Otherwise, many people will unknowingly return this great phone
Once the navigation also works (without data plan and go online), I really think this phone is EXCELLENT, especially compare its prices/functions with iPhone
 Of course, I agree iPhone may give a more fancy illusion and is falsely perceived as a more fashion toy

I just purchases a Nokia 5800 from Amazon
 One of the first things I tried was to connect to my wireless network
 I have never had a problem connecting to my wireless network with laptops, printer, and my son's iTouch
 Every time I try to connect to the network the phone says I'm connected but when I try to browse a website I receive the message "No Gateway Reply"
 After spending several hours trying to figure out the issue I contacted the Nokia helpdesk and they said the phone has issues connecting to Wifi
 They sent me a shipping label to have the 5800 sent to their repair facility in Alabama
 I packaged up the phone and sent it in for repair
A week later the 5800 came back with a note that they did a "Software Upgrade and Phone Reset"
 I turned on the phone and connected to my wireless network and then as soon as I tried to open a web page I received the "No gateway reply" message again
 I called the Nokia helpdesk again and they said they didn't have any record of my phone, Grrr
 I gave them the serial number and finally they figured out that the phone had been sent in for repair
 I asked the Nokia support person what they were going to do and she said she would escalate to some other group and that they would get back to me in the next 48 working hours - whatever that means
I am very disappointed with this phone and company

I love, love this phone



couldn't afford the iphone so guess what the next bestest thing is







My nokia 5800 xpress music phone

First of all, Amazon is one of the best website I ever seen
About Nokia 5800, I love this cellphone

Bought this phone almost a week ago
 I am still trying to update the firmware
 I use Windows 7
 The enclosed cd refuses to work
 It says I have no internet connection, but I do
 Then I downloaded the OVI suite to try an update that way
 Had a horrible time trying to get the download to install
 I finally got it to install as "administrator" on the 3rd attempt
 Once installed, I tied to update the phone and it still won't update firmware via OVI suite
 I then attempted to update via the phone itself via wireless connection
 Keep getting as error this way too
 I don't think it is a firewall issue
 But feel lost
 I've called Nokia customer service
 Each time you get a nice lady with a heavy foreign accent
 I mention this because it is hard to communicate back and forth
 The first time I called the lady said I must contact my internet provider for assistance
 Well they had no clue as to why since my internet was working and everything attached worked
 Called Nokia back again and the nice lady promised that a technician would contact me withing 24 to 48 hours
 Never happened
 Called back a 3rd time and the nice lady said she was going to look for my records and after 10 minutes never came back on the phone
 This is all too frustrating
 The phone itself works alright, but I am unable to download OVI maps because I have outdated firmware
One last complaint
 I cannot find an app for internet music
 I found one on the Nokia site but it was for older models
 I have a Nokia N8100 internet tablet and it has a great internet music app
 Can't believe this phone doesn't
 I am about to give up and send this back
Update
 On the 7th day


I tried once again to update the firmware via wifi & phone and it connected and updated on first attempt
 Great
 But another thing happened that is really strange
 A call came in and the phone vibration started
 But it would not stop
 It just kept vibrating and the keys locked up
 After a couple of minutes I just pulled the battery and inserted it and it was alright
 Strange phone

This phone has met all my expectations
 The built-in GPS is fantastic
 From time to time, it takes a while to lock, but once it does, it works really well
 I am currently using the endoMondo sports app, and the way it works with the GPS and the auto-upload feature make this thing an amazing exercise tracker for walking, running and biking
 The free navigation and turn by turn with voice instructions works as well as any GPS that I have seen
 The touch-screen isn't as "cool" as the iPhone, but then again, I am not "stuck" with a data plan
 The phone works great, and the battery life is at least as good as I expected, probably better
 The web browsing is fine for the simple things I would use a device like this for
 I have been surprised by the user interface, allowing a touch on things like the clock or the profile setting display to change or display additional info
 In short, I have no regrets whatsoever for having purchased this phone
 Yes, there are better phones out there


 but nowhere near the low price of this phone

I'm writing this review from the perspective of an American who lives and travels overseas
 Because of this, I was looking for an unlocked, quad-band GSM phone that had 3G, Wifi, GPS, a decent screen size for video and a good app selection
 Plus, I wanted this all at a reasonable price since I would not be getting any plan subsidy
 Using this criteria the 5800 seemed perfect and there are a lot of great things about this phone for the traveler which I'll go into later
 The main negative I found was that the American version of this handset and the others in its product line do not support 3G outside of the Americas
 The 5800 American edition does not support the UMTS (3G) 2100 frequency (Wikipedia has an entry under "list of UMTS networks" that show which carriers use which frequency)
 Now the point can be made that I bought American edition and shouldn't be surprised that it won't pick up 3G in other countries
 The only problem is that almost all of Nokia's other American version 3G handsets like the N97, X6 and E75 (my wife's phone)do support the 2100 frequency
 To be fair, the 5800 will support EDGE networks wherever you want to go and if you use a browser like opera mini, you may not even notice that much of a difference in general web browsing
 It's just something to consider if you are looking at this as an international travel phone and a fast data connection is important to you
Now the 5800 does have some very nice features for the traveler that should be noted
 First and foremost is the ability to pre-install free Ovi maps in your phone before you get on the plane
 This allows you to use the 5800's GPS with voice directions without an active data connection
 This is something that other free mapping services, like Google maps, cannot do
 Of course you could go with third party software like Ndrive and pay up to $70 per map
 Personally, I'll go with free
 Of course with Nokia there is usually a catch
 This one is that not every Nokia handset that has a GPS gets free Ovi maps
 The 5800 does but my wife's E75, a phone released the same year and is much more expensive than the 5800, does not
 If you are looking at other other Nokia phones and this feature is important to you, then check make sure the phone can use free Ovi maps
Another important travel feature is that the 5800 has Wifi
 If you spend time overseas, you will probably be buying local pre-paid sim cards (the 5800's quad-band GSM capability lets you do that everywhere) with no or expensive data service
 Therefore, Wifi is essential
 Find a free hot spot at a coffee shop and you can check your email, tweet, update your Facebook and make Skype calls back home
 The Nokia catch here is that connecting with Wifi can be a mysterious and confusing process
 You would think that once you hook up to a Wifi connection then that the phone would automatically use that connection as the default
 We'll you would be wrong
 The first thing you need to do is go into all your applications that go online and insure that the default connection is set to "always ask"
 That way you can select the connection you want the app to use
 If you don't then the 5800 may or may not use the free Wifi connection and instead drain the money out of your sim card without you noticing
As for long train, plane and automobile rides, the 5800 is a very decent media player
 It has a standard 3
5mm audio jack and the music playback is very good quality
 The screen is on the small side for video, coming in at 3
2 inches, but it is very high res at 360 by 640 and hence the video is sharp and clear
 The screen is also in 16:9 widescreen format that means that the black bar problem on widescreen movies is not so noticeable
 You will need to convert your videos to the MP4 format for the installed Real Player, but you would want to do that anyway to bring the file size down
 Nokia also provides a generous 8 GB micro SD card, that can be upgraded to 16 GB
 That means that right out of the box you can put a lot of media on the phone, without having to spend money on a bigger SD card
As for apps, the 5800 uses the S60V5 software and the phone has been out long enough that there are a fair amount of apps for the phone
 You may have to dig for it, but pretty much everything I want the 5800 to do, and I want it to do a quite a lot, there is an app out there to let me do it
 The difference with Apple and Android is that you may have 10 flavors of apps to do the 1 task you want, while with S60v5 you will probably only have one
 The Nokia catch here is that S60V5 is a tough operating system to get to know and work with
 It is not intuitive and can be initially very frustrating, but with time you get used to it's quirks and there's lot's of support on-line in different forums to help you learn the ropes
In the end I was looking for a phone that if I was traveling very light could do all the things a basic netbook could do
 Despite it's lack of 3G outside North and South America, the 5800 does meet those expectations
 With a small folding Bluetooth keyboard (The Iphone won't let you do that yet) and a battery backup charger (get one that uses either AA or AAA batteries so you can keep replacing the batteries)I can watch movies, listen to music, write long emails or notes and play games for all of my long haul flights and layovers
 There is even an e-book app (ereader) that works pretty well if you bump the font up
 Then when I finally do get to my destination, I can fire up the GPS and load a local sim card and I'm moving and communicating in no time
 All this for a reasonable price without a contract
There is no question that Nokia delivers great hardware value with their handsets
 The challange for Nokia will be to develop a operating system with plenty of apps that let's the user smoothly and easily take advantage of all that great hardware
 With stores in the US selling $99 dollar 8GB IPhone 3GSs (with a two year contract), there is becoming less and less reason for folks to put up with Nokia's "Quirks
"
There is no sense in reviewing the features since that's already pretty well covered
I searched Amazon for the best cell phone with WiFi sorted by ratings
 This item came up at the top of the list at the price range I was looking for
 That is one of the best features with Amazon in my opinion
Boy, I am not at all dissapointed
 This is simply the best phone I've ever had or that I've ever seen
 It does everything I could ask for in a phone, and it is totally useable as an Internet device
 It is small enough to carry on your hip, less than 1/2 inch taller than a closed Razr V3, yet large enough to read a book or a web page pretty easily
 And of course you can turn the phone for a landscape view
 Plus, it is light as a feather as compared to an HTC for example
I have it set up to ask me what network I want to use everytime I access the browser
 That way, I can use WiFi whenever it is availabe
 I switched from T-Mobile prepay to AT&T prepay so I could get the monthly data package of 100mb for $[


]
 This works perfectly for me
 From what I've read, I can re-fill the data package for $[


] each month for 1mb and roll over the unused data
 I also pay an additional $[


] per month for 200 text messages since AT&T charges 
20 per text
 And, at $
[


] a call, I just try to avoid the voice and send email or texts
 The $[


] prepay re-fill will last a year and each of these monthly items get deducted from my prepay balance, along with the phone minutes
 I really don't use the phone very much, and I would usually get away with about $[


] per month on T-Mobile
 With the AT&T data plan and texting, I figure it should be closer to $[


] per month
 Not a bad deal compared to the T-Mobile minimum unlimited data plan at $[


]/mo plus $
[


] per call, or AT&T/T-Mobile @ $[


]/mo plus outrageous taxes for calls and data
The big plus is that this phone is DESIGNED to be used unlocked from any carrier
 Unlike the Blackberry, where you have to figure out ways to bypass their network, the Nokia 5800 Xpressmusic sets you up to avoid the carrier and tries to warn you as much as possible that you may incur data charges
 VERY HELPFUL
 I Highly recommend this phone
 It is an excellent value
EDIT: I just received my AMEX $[


] rebate debit card today 8/2/10 (Rebates always feel like a crap-shoot to me), so now I'm even happier with my first Nokia buying experience
 Total cost was $[


] less $[


] or $[


]

This cel phone is very good with a very good price
 It has 3G tec, batery life is also good, menu is friendly and easy to work
 The signal reception is excellent
 Touchscreen is good
 Easy to update software version

excellent product and excellent sellerI am very happy with customer serviceexcellent ,excellent ,excellent ,excellent
I've owned this phone for about 6 months now, and today I'm mailing in for repair, for reasons I'll get to in a minute
 Until a few weeks ago I thought it was a decent phone, a cost effective alternative to a 2-year iphone contract and iphone data
 It's a very capable phone, the GPS works great, and once you download another browser (I used Opera Mobile [not Opera Mini]) it's a good little internet phone
 The camera's great
 Call quality and reception generally were better than my friends' iphones
 Because it's an unlocked phone, there were a handful of useful things I could that iphone users couldn't, like download an app that allowed me to take my 3G connection and make a WIFI hotspot


tethering, basically
 I also made much use of the vast array of podcasts available for download directly to the phone
 My main complaint when it was working was that there just weren't that many desirable apps, at least not compared to iphone, blackberry, or android
 Streaming data was possible, for example, but whereas many sources of streaming data (like CSPAN or NPR) have apps for more popular phones, I had to seek out links at great length
Anyway, about a week ago I started having minor software glitches
 The phone wouldn't interact properly with hands free headsets, certain menu options were unavailable
 Basic ones, like bringing up the dial pad to make a phone call
 So I call Nokia
 They tell me to reset it, which is a no brainer, but when that didn't work, they were useless
 I visit their "support" site, which is equally useless, except for the forum of users who offer each other advice based on what they've been able to dig up in spite of Nokia
 I send an email to ask a specific question
 Nokia did not answer my email, other that an auto-response message saying that they would get back to me "promptly"
 That was a week ago
 During this process I discover (no thanks to Nokia) that I cannot update my firmware over the air (direct to the phone) or with my computer, which happens to be a Mac
 I need Windows
 Okay, so I get Windows, back the phone up using Nokia's OVI Suite and then begin the update
 OVI Suite crashes, Windows closes it, and my phone is now a paper weight
 The only option left to me is to mail the phone in and do without for "7-10 days"
 We'll see about that
 Not holding my breath
If I had the decision to make over I would probably buy an iphone
 I still think this is a great phone, and I'm sure not everyone will have the same problem as I did, just be warned that if you do, it's a huge hassle

I have been using the phone about a month now
 Everything is good except for the battery
 It's never given me any warning, just shut the phone off when the battery is out
 The volume is very limited comparing with other type of phone from Nokia
 I like the Nokia N95 NAM version that I had before, the battery life was longer,and the sound was much better
 I paid only $240 for the Nokia 5800 comparing with $600 for the N95, so I should not complain

Good product, excelent
The box it came in was pretty beat up, but outside of that, the phone works awesome
 For full disclosure, I'm not the user of the phone, a friend is, and they have no complaints, other than the box, so I have no complaints either
 The phone got here functional, so I could care less of what shape the box was in, although it did make me wonder if the phone would work at all, and it did, so everybody is happy

all is ok
No comments

Okay as a backup phone
 Nothing to special

Ok
Excelente
Excellent, I have not had any problems and the cost is very good, I recommend it

EXCELENTE
Great phone
 Pioneer of its kind
 Symbian is a truly unique OS that just needs a few kinks worked out

This is a Cheap made in China phone with a very ugly camera and video quality, it takes terrible pictures
If that is Nokia's response to the iPhone, then Apple can rest for the next 2 years
I bought the phone because it is unlocked and I don't want to pay ATT data plan for two years
 It also has Wi-Fi, Blue Tooth and GPS
What I like about the phone:1/ It is very sleek and fits snugly in the hand2/ The voice quality and the speakers are excellent and have enough power3/ It has WiFi and Bluetooth4/ I am a stylus type of guy and I like the handwriting capability - probably the best feature5/ Changing the SIM or the SD is a snap
What I don't like1/ Making a phone call is pathetic - how many clicks do I have to make in order to make a simple phone call
 And why does it have to ask me if I want to make a video call 


 Like I do video calls from my land line
2/ So far I haven't found a way to do phone card call, without having to type in about 20 digits
3/ Could not manage to get the blue tooth conduit to run with my Vista Laptop
 Vista asks for a driver, Nokia says that they have provided the driver
4/ Even the full size QWERTY is very difficult to use
 You need to press much harder on the LCD so fat fingering is very common
5/ Help and support are pathetic6/ The battery died after about 8 hours, during which time I had made 3-4 calls
 It virtually died it went from full charge to almost empty in a matter of 10 minutes
All in all, I am considering to return it and get a phone that actually works, without having to have manicure or three hands
============================================ 10 DAYS LATER UPDATE:-------------------------------Here we go:PROS:1/ The battery issue disappeared after about 1 week nightly recharging
 Now the battery indicator has a tendency to be 100% all day long, and I do talk more than when I was testing the phone
 I am not sure if the indicator is correct, but at least it has not let me down while I am talking
2/ The phone has relatively decent "Voice Command" feature
 That resolved my issue with the number of clicks to make a simple phone call
3/ I received an SMS from NOKIA - telling me how to turn my GPS feature on
 That was awfully nice of them - ~2 hours after the activation the GPS found me
 Obviously there is a "soak" period
 So don't expect immediate results
 The "soak" period also falls in the CONS category
4/ I must admit that the "Camera" is fairly decent
 Having said that - I did not buy the phone because of the camera
 If you need a camera - "you buy a camera"
 I am looking more into the "organizer" functionality
 ("I-DON'T-have-to-attach-my laptop-to-my-butt-but-it-helps-if-handy) kinda' application
CONS:1/ The voice command works fairly well
 The problem is that NOKIA has prerecorded commands from, I am sure, some terrific Finnish guy, who has a terrible Finnish accent (as far as English is concerned)
 That is easy to overcome, as far as Applications are concerned (you can override him with your voice), but I am yet to figure out how to change the preconceived notions, as far as "Contacts" are concerned - I cannot figure how to create a voice command to call my wife, unless I mimic the Finish guy's ideas as to how to pronounce a name
2/ The DTMF issue is a real problem
 I do a lot of call card calls and conference calls
 The phone has "Copy --> Paste" function, but this does not cut it
 There MUST be a way to pre-program your call-in numbers, and log-in with 1-2 'clicks'
I do understand that "One" is not supposed to talk on the phone while driving, but this is "One's" decisions
 By no means it is NOKIA's decision
3/ In order to access features there is a substantial time lapse between the moment the feature is activated ( you click) and the moment you can use the feature
 I wonder why is that


WHO IS WATCHING


 AND WHAT that "WHO" IS
The long "soak" frustrated me and invoked questions about the safe keeping of my privacyCONCLUSIONThis phone is an acquired taste 


 or maybe Symbian is an acquired taste 


 I don't know
It has potential, if NOKIA fixes the annoyances in the firmware - e
g
 the voice command works fine, minus the Finnish accent
 GPS works,AND people know how to make it work and what to expect
 (SMS simply does not cut it)
There is no way to convince me that this phone is user friendly
 It simply is not
 You can easily access the most basic features, but if you want to do something beyond basics - it is a nightmare
I am sorry, but I do not buy a "cheap" $340 phone, just to figure out how to make a phone call, or take a note, or make an appointment, or take a picture
 I buy it to be able to do all of the above - EASY
And learning how to do that has to take place in "reasonable" time - say 1-2 hours
 This is not the case
 So far I have invested about 8 hours to figure out the some of the questions, that are most annoying
 Probably it will take twice as much to figure the answers
How about an brand new idea
 How about, a user guide that actually guides you


 Or how about some useful webcasts, that would teach you how to use the phone features, without having to spend 7 days trying to figure them out 


 What a challenge 


THE VERDICTI WILL KEEP the phone
I will keep it, simply because, based on my experience and judging by reviews about the competition, it is MORE acceptable
It is nowhere near to the iPhone, but that is another can of worms
I expect huge improvements from NOKIA on:1/ User interface2/ User manuals or instructions3/ Ease of use - functionality
All of the above can be fixed by software, so I am expecting the upgrades
Happy upgrading 

Enough said - 2-1/2 stars - FINAL 
============++++++++++++++++++============LAST UPDATEThe headphones coming with the phone are AMAZING 


Easily comparable to BOSE
I heard depth and breadth of music, that I hadn't experienced in a long time
 (That is after I figured how to copy the music to the phone, and how to start it)
 Seriously - the sound from the headphones is exceptional 
Maybe it is what it says "XpressMusic" - I will give to NOKIA that - Music is PERFECT 


 Much better than my wife's iPod 
Still - 3 stars for the overall phone - MAX
Music on the headphones is excellent though

The phone is an acquired taste 



Really good touch phone, I definetly think its the best touch phone out there right next to the Iphone
 The Speakers are Loud and Crisp for music
 The Screen is responsive, and the vibration feedback, is not annoying at all
- The Camera could be better though, and the flash doesn't seem to help, alot of the time sadly-VERY IMPORTANT, the real reason why i didn't give this phone (that I was reaaally excited for) is because the second day I had it, I used the tv- out cable to see some vids, it FROZE and shut off, now SINCE then there is a horizontal line around the bottom of my screen, and it NEVER goes away :'[
Phone worked well out of the box
 (AT&T user, just insert your old phones SIM and go
 However, for texting you have to go to the set up menu and input the AT&T message center phone number, otherwise your text/s will stay in the Outbox)
 Music is great with clear sound
 Camera has a flash and works for night scenes, but the resolution is not that great
 Wi-Fi is automatically scanned just like a laptop does
 Haven't downloaded all the Nokia apps to check out all the functions this smartphone can do
 Expanding memory is easy with a phone slot on the side to max out to 16 GB
 Great Amazon price, quick shipment, way more positive add ons than the overpriced Iphone
 Video webcam available via 2 cameras, not locked on to a monthly $30 data plan like the Iphone, battery on par with my previous cell phones, touch screen is as good as it gets
 You can also just add AT&T's media data plan down the road if you need 24/7 websurfing, think its about $15
 All in all, Nokia 5800 is a winner; not as well known, then again you're not going to stand out as one of the Apple peeps out there

I have officially had this phone for 1 week, and so far so good

 for a smart phone virgin
 I have synced fairly easily, download some apps and listen to podcasts without issue
 Great internet connect and connected within my wireless network with no issues
 The only problem I had was obtaining my contacts from from my old Nokia 5300(way behind in technology I know), phone swap did not work for me
 Anway, after I saved my contacts to my SIM, and placed it back in this phone, all was well that ended well
 I also thought it was wierd that the guitar game was in Spanish

 Good thing I speak the language
 I really like the guitar pick stylus and the music stand
I Overall, I'm more than satisfied with this purchase, and still playing with my new toy, and I just appreciate the freebies including amazon video credit and free map trial
 It's pretty easy to use for someone who has never had a touch screen before, and even has a help screen in every section plus tip video clips
 There are tons of shortcuts which is cool
 I really like that you don't have to take the cover off the back to swap the memory card as well
 Just wish it came with a case



Not so great phone after all,

 I owned almost every Nokia phones
Touch screen so wimpy,

 very hard to navigation around
 Impossibly to scroll down the phone book and stopping by the correct name
Also phone dead now,

when power up
 Screen said Return to provider for service, boot up fail

hi, first lets setup my parameters
 I am a Tmobile subscriber from Tampa Bay area
 My reception is the highest available
 I have owned in order a Ericson from the PCS days, a Panasonic from ATT/Cingular days, Nokia 6120, 6131, Tmobile Dash, Tmobile Shadow, Nokia N95 8GB (for 3 weeks but then the display went out and i got scared to want to replace it so i returned it
 Please also note this is my second time owning a Nokia 5800
 The first time was a European model with US warranty since i got it from the Nokia Flagship store in Chicago
 That had the first firmware with no updates


and it sucked
 Sucked so bad I sold it used because I couldnt wait for the firmware upgrade
 So now we advance to today
 And with great relief, I tell you people that this Nokia 5800 Nam is an outstanding smartphone
 The most current firmware 20
0
012 has made this Nok great
 I know this because I have owned both
 I take off 
50 because no the UI is not as pretty as the Iphone, nothing is when it comes to touch
 the other 
25 is because when you activate the pretty animations for the touch interface, it does slow it down
 So I do turn it off to keep it running smoothly
 This is a best seller for Nokia, therefore they will continue to give us better software updates to make it run even smoother
 Their is no crazy ear piece problem
 The phone feels so easy fitting in one hand
 This cant be said of the Iphone
 The Iphone is awsome yes, but its kinda big to use as a cellphone
 ok let me real this in
 The phone works great clear LOUD speaker phone, great fun snap shoot digital camera, great flash abilities to stream web content, great call quality, very pretty screen
 As for the touch method, the iphone once again is kewler and smooth however the resistive touch screen is CLEARLY improved and does not hold you back
 Clearly the firmware upgrade tweaked the sensitivity and made it much more responsive
 im all over the place with this review, im sorry
 if only Nokia could do better marketin partnerships and get this to a local Best Buy so people can touch it and feel how great it is


that for me is one of it biggest selling points



I think this is a great phone
 The problem is that when I received it, it had already been opened
 Amazon sent me a package that someone had returned
 They are taking it back
 The other problem is the ear piece speaker
 You can;t determine when the phones were manufactured
 Any phone manufactured before around mid February was probably manufactured with the faulty ear piece speaker
 You can order then get it fixed if it fails under warranty, but that is a pain for me as i don't live near a Nokia care Center

Ever since I have used smart phones, nokia and symbian s60 has been my favorites, my last two phones being the n95-3 and the e71
 I was hoping to hold out until the n97 but decided to give the 5800 a try
The phone itself is built very solidly for a midrange phone, there's no worry about dropping it and having it break on you, the screen is also very nice, this may not be the slimmest phone out there but it feels very comfortable in your hand, and the resolution looks amazing
 I have a minor concern with the battery cover, it seems like it was more of an afterthought in the design of the device, there is no buttons or latches to secure it, just a few tabs that u click it into


I hope this doesn't break on me quickly




but I don't see a need to be removing the cover very often, as the memory card and SIM card are inserted through the side, meaning this phone can have its memory cards switched very easily
The user interface seems like a quick and dirty job, it is basically the s60 v3 operating system with some bigger icons to make selection by touch a little easier
 Not a major overhaul on the operating system basically everything looks the same as previous nokia smart phones, the camera, video, and music interfaces could have made better use of finger controls in my opinion
Another major concern that hopefully will be alleviated soon is the lack of third party apps, I'm assuming this operating system is still an infant and over time developers will start adapting their existing apps to use on touch devices
Handwriting recognition is my favorite input methods, although the full screen QWERTY comes in a close second
 The t9 keypad works great for one handed operations, and the mini QWERTY keyboard is a joke
I was disappointed to see that the US version does not ship with an extra stylus, NOR DOES IT HAVE A CARRYING CASE

Functionality is very excellent and useful (multiple alarms, wife, touch-screen) but I have twice experienced that after charging overnight, the next day the unit will get very, very warm and will just die
 Returned it for safety reason

I had upgraded the micro SD card from a 8 gig to a 16 gig
 Afterwhich, I uploaded 8+ gig apps, music and video
 Upon restarting the phone, the OS would not boot past the Nokia blue welcome screen
 The phone would then just freeze at the screen
 I had to perform a hard reset and remove the memory card in order to have the phone boot up properly
 Then, I removed some apps, music and video below 8 gigs for the phone to boot properly
 I returned the phone because it didn't live up to what it was advertised



being able to handle 16 gigs
 I, then, borrowed my friend's Euro-spec version of the phone and it seemed to work without any problems

Too much to be truth
1
 I put Garmin software and works just like a Garmin GPS
I can also use Google maps in which you can walk or drive your car and see your position on the satellite image
2
 3G signal is always 100% even in rural Costa Rica where I live
3
 I put Joikuspot and it works as a 1
5 Mbps router, anywhere I go
Right now I am using it to write this on my Ubuntu laptop
4
 Sync with Google Calendar and contacts fast and excellent
-why should anyone need Exchange Server anymore



5
 Excellent camera, video recorder, I even scan documents with it even if I have a scanner around
6
 Offline multilanguage dictionary7
 Excellent video, music and audio book player8
 Bright flashlightI miss is a portable bluetooth keyboard, PDF and office reader, but all are available
Well I would love the IPhone's beautiful and smooth interfase (which is far better than any other) plus snooze options for remindersToo much and too good to be truth
 No
The Nokia5800 XPress is really an outdated smartphone for a high price
 Turn on WiFi is cumberson and always 3 step process through the menu
 Aside the telephone functionality it has no intuitive user interface
 Save the money and get a smartphone of a newer generation or keep the old cell phone and get an iPod touch

Excellent device for a good price
 You can have all the right solutions in your hand, such as internet navigation, email and multimedia
 Easy to use, easy to install new and cool applications like GPS maps and games
 Better than Iphone, and trust me, I'm a true Mac user
Cool design, small and light weight
 The 8Gb microSD card it's perfect to store data, music and videos, but if you need more space you can upgrade it with a 16GB card

This phone is too complicated to use
 I had this phone for almost a month now and I still couldn't figure out how to use some of the features without using the manual book
 The battery only last a couple days after fully charged
 The headphone wire is way too short
 The lengh is from your ear to your upper chest
 Therefore, unless your coat has a pocket on your upper chest, you have to hold your phone in front of your chest everytime you try to enjoy the music quietly
I will not recommend this phone to a friend

Power off your NokiaBefore removing your tiny memory card, take note of the orientation as you are removing it, if you forget RTFM (Read The Find Manual)Power on your NokiaA screen will show up asking if you want to get out of the offline modeSelect "YES", thank God
If you select "NO", you Idiot
, repeat this instruction from the beginning
Good Luck mate





































Source (Thanks to Nigel):I have a nokia N80 smartphone with the latest firmware (v5)
 I also have lots of customized applications installed
Yesterday I switched it to offline mode, and then powered down
MISTAKE
On powering up I then got prompted for "Do you wish to stay in offline mode" but regardless of what I entered it would not go online, and was running slow
 A very smart phone now


 :-(I tried all combinations of power up/down, menus etc to no avail, although did notice on shutdown I could see the "Enter PIN" dialogue, but it was hidden/in the background and inaccessible
Finally I removed the memory card and it switched to online mode perfectly
 I was then able to replace the memory card & things carried on working fine
So I guess some sw interaction - but a useful tip - if you get stuck in offline mode, try booting up without memory card
 I also recommend installing all except critical software to the memory card - makes it easy to disable in case of any problems-- Nigel

 If you follow the instruction verbatim, you might end up confusing your self like I did
 Best of luck

De entrada es magestuosa su presentación
 Totalemtne tactil, amigable y poderoso
 Existe la posibilidad de agregarle mas capacidad de memoria a través de la ranura de expansion, yo ya encargue una de 16gb, ya que de paquete trae una de 8gb
 95% recomendable, el resto 5% no lo recomendaría por ser algo complicado con el sistema de posicionamiento de GPS, a una semana de haber activado la cuenta de un mes gratis, no me he podido conectar con ningun satelite, no de modo general ni de modo asistido
 Y justamente esta herramienta del GPS fue lo que me llamo la atencion al momento de hacer la compra por lo cual me siento un poco frustado
 Espero conseguir la solucion al problema lo más pronto posible
 En lo multimedia perfecto, en sonido externo fenomenal, es altamente recomendado, los videos corren de maravilla
 Graba video, y toma fotos como un profesional
 En resumen, si se solventa lo del GPS y el satelite, sería el mejor telefono del momento

I Got this Phone yesterday and i`m returning it
The phone is just OK
 and the sound Quality is the worst ever
It does not worth the high price
I Cant Recommend this Phone
And I`ve had bad times with Nokia Phones
UPDATE:Before you buy this phone, Google, Create New Server Profile Nokia 5800
 This is a Common Problem, And Nokia Has no Answer For this

I both this cellphone hear in Amazon, and when i looking for a PIN CODE in a box of product to active the promotion NOKIA COMES WHITH MUSIC for download 8000 musics on computer free, i can't
 This code never come in a box, only cellphone, manual, charger and jack's phone (include ipod jack - surprise for me)
 I liked so much this cellphone, include beautiful disign, longer battery, widescreen quality and the functionally
 Only negative point is the side's of video and photo, because i can't turn to right side to see a video, for exemple, it has only left side default
 Somebody know how can I get this PIN code, or if is possible call to NOKIA USA to see that whith a serial number can active NOKIA COMES WHITH MUSIC
 What is phone number
Waiting your opnion Friends,Maia, Vinicius
This phone crashed all the time
 A few times it took hours to recover
 Each time it crashed you lost data and you had to reconfigure it
 Being for AT&T, this phone is impossible to upgrade the windows OS
 Much software you can't get for it

While this appeared to be a good deal, as I was looking for a phone that would not require a data plan, this phone did not do the trick
 It received calls when I put my Pay-as-you-go card in it but refused to connect to the Internet
 I spent over two hours on the phone with AT&T representatives, supervisors, tech level II people, and finally after trying everything, they concluded that this is a smartphone and needs a data plan
 So it should be listed as a smartphone 



Does just about everything a smart phone does without the expense of adding a data plan
 My son loves it and I feel that it was worth my money
 He can listen to music, take pictures, or look up something on the Internet
 Just not the smart phone price

Great phone with wonderful features and was designed for those who want the combination of a music player and a phone in one along with the added features to enjoy them both to their fullest

EXCELENTE PRODUCTO
 LLEGO EN BUEN ESTADO A VENEZUELA
 CELULAR DE GRAN CALIDAD
 RECOMIENDO AL VENDEDOR RESPONSABLE Y EFECTIVO
 ESPERO PODER DISFRUTAR OTROS PRODUCTOS
buen vendedor el producto llego en buenas condiciones, lo recomiendo muy bonito cell y tiene buen precio pueden comprar con confianza
En realidad todo llego bien y es un muy buen equipo lo recomiendo fue una entrega rápida recomiendo al vendedor
Feels cheap as a whole this phone is cheap do not waste your money
 Made of plastic and extremely cheap I cannot say cheap enough

Buenas tardes quiciera copia de la factura de este producto, es muy bueno aunque despues de un tiempo tube problemas con la pantalla
One of the best cells i've got
Real heavy duty, good performance even with its 400 Mhz cpu
 There are a lot of better options right now
But if you are new (as i was to smartphones) this one can do many tricks

I have used lots of different phones, from the basic Razr flip phone through several different Windows Mobile & Blackberry smart phones, and even the greatly over-hyped iPhone, and this is by far my favorite phone
Symbian has a lot better performance and stability than Windows Mobile
 The Nokia 5800 is more fun than a Blackberry
 And the iPhone
 Well, it's really just a "feature" phone (aka dumb phone) posing as a smart phone
 The iPhone is great for what it can do, but terrible for what it can't do
The Nokia 5800 XpressMusic is a truly useful and functional communication and entertainment device
 It is the best convergence device I have used to date
 It excels as a phone with great call quality and RF reception (I get 3G signals where other phones barely get 2G, or even no signal at all)
 As a media device it features second to none audio quality (with good encoding and headphones it sounds incredible), and a truly amazing screen for photo viewing and video playback
 And as a web/communication device it has one of the best mobile browsers available (full HTML with support for Java and Flash) with applications available for popular IM and social networking sites (ICQ, AIM, MSN, Yahoo, Jabber, IRC, Googletalk, Skype, Facebook, Myspace, Twitter and more) and email with support for attachments (POP, IMAP, SMTP, MFE)
 And since it's all controlled by the Symbian multi-tasking OS, you can use just about any combination of applications and features you want (within the limits of the phone's memory)
Nokia has been supporting this phone well with several major (free) firmware updates since it was released late last year
 Be sure to update to the latest firmware, because there have been significant improvements in performance and stability, as well as new features added
It's small and light weight with reasonably solid construction
 While it is a little thicker than some other touch screen phones, it is also narrower and has a very nice fit and feel in hand while not being overly bulky in your pocket
It's about as loaded as you can get feature wise
 Besides what I mentioned above, it's got tactile (Haptic) feedback
 Accelerometer
 GPS with A-GPS and navigation software (Nokia/Ovi Maps)
 Dual-band high speed HSDPA 3
5G (WCDMA 850/1900 MHz) and multi-band international calling support (GSM/EDGE 850/900/1800/1900 MHz)
 WiFi 802
11g network support
 3
2MP camera with auto-focus, dual-LED flash and video recording (plus a 2nd front camera for video calling)
 FM Radio
 Media player (audio & video) with "Flight" mode for use during airline travel
 Photo browser
 Multiple input options (full screen QWERTY, mini QWERTY, T9 with predictive text, and handwriting recognition)
 Expandable memory (microSDHC 8GB included, can accept larger cards as well)
 User changeable battery
 Really loud and surprisingly good sounding speakers
 3
5mm Nokia AV connector (for standard stereo headphones and audio/video TV output)
 Bluetooth 2
0 with support for Stereo audio (A2DP & AVRCP)
 Speed dial
 Voice dialing (SIND speaker independent dialing and voice commands)
 PC sync software
The 5800 XM runs on Symbian S60 v5, a true multi-tasking smart phone OS
 But because Nokia markets this as an XpressMusic phone, you can use it with AT&T's cheap medianet data plans, or just use WiFi without any data plan at all if you prefer (I've got unlimited data for $10/month on the family plan)
You simply cannot beat this phone's combination of features, performance and price

I bought my Nokia 5800 XM from Amazon & used the free shipping option
 It arrived at my APO address here in Kuwait in 5 DAYS
What a deal
The phone is great, & easy to figure out & use
 The only bad thing was the memory card came with some music samples /folders on it which I could not delete
 I could delete the songs, but not the file folder
 An error message would appear saying that the file was corrupted
 Finally I formatted the memory card & that erased all the preloaded junk on it
 Now I have only my stuff on the card so


 format the card BEFORE adding anything to it
Aside from having to do that, it's a great phone, lots of features, basically everything I'll ever need & much more
 It's truly a mobile device, not just a phone
Oh, the camera pics are OK


 just OK
 Not really that great, but not really that bad either

I have had this phone for several months
 I bought the unlocked version because I travel a lot and wanted to be able to buy sim cards in various countries
I have found the phone to be extremely powerful with a vast array of features
 The touch screen took some getting used to and I found the interface difficult at first
 But now I can navigate without any problem
 The user manual and "help" is essentially useless, but I have figured most things out just fine
 I had trouble sending texts initially, but after going through some fixes on the Nokia user forum I got that solved (it had to do with message center settings)
One of my favorite features is the music player
 It has freed me from my iPod
 Uploading and playing music is easy and intuitive
 The camera is nice but I don't ask much of it
 The GPS feature is really cool but it takes a long time to find satellites
 It's only really useful if you're in network range although you can get a GPS fix when out of range
 If you leave the GPS function running by accident though it seems to drain the battery quickly
 Speaking of the battery though, I've found the battery to last quite a long time otherwise though
 Several days with normal phone use and music playing
 The computer interface is easy
One other minor negative is that it seems the screen can be scratched easily
 Be careful
I'd definitely buy this phone again and recommend it to others who are not afraid of solving minor tech issues

i buy this phone bcos i want to use it as phone and i-pod like i-phone, i use t-mobile service which is far cheap than at&t's i-phone service

now i already use this phone for more than a month

first what i like about the phone1 it has 3
5mm audio jack where i can connect any speakers to use it as mp3 music player its at top like i pod
2 8gb memory card enough to hold your likable 100 songs,10-15 videos and 1 movie in it
like i have in it
3 sreen display quality is good
video quality is also real good4 wifi is good
 and browser also good loads all kind of web pages
it dont play flash videos

big no no for me

5 gps also work great

its capable of giving your exact location when you are on road


 i load whole Texas(us) maps on it and it takes 200 mb of my space

but if you have web connection on phone go with google maps application
 nokia's ovi maps are far behind google
 for usa ovi maps dont works great i dont know about eurore or asia

6 desktop shortcuts are good but we need more than 4
7 calender,clock aplications are good
8 camera flash is bright i load torch software on phone and i can use it as torch also
dont like abou the phone

1 cheap plastic body of phone
dont robost as nokia phones

shaking body
2 camera picture quality is too bad

 it is 3
2mp only to take space consuming pics

 clarity of pics is too bad and there little color difference in pics too

picture quality is little better when outside under sun
camera really disappoint you
3 not easy to access the lists like phonebook
 you have to scroll by using side scroll bar
 you dont scroll the list from contacts like in i phone
 and there is no up-down buttons on phone
if you have long list of cantacts like 150 and you want to scroll from scrollbar
you are unable to stop on contact you want from scrollbar it run too fast
(long list same scrollbar)
4 when you have to dial the number in between of call like-->slect 1 for english 2for spanish -->some time it dont take your input value

i remember lot of times teller machine told to "hung up and try again"
bcos it dont get the input from me

5 no security for data

 anybody in your family or friend can access you photos,videos,masseges etc there is not even a simple pasword securiy on phone

 pin number only works when you restart the phone
6 screen unlock key is provided at the side of phone
which is sliding one i dont think this key lasts long time
because every time i have to use the ihave to use that key

even to look for time

 in i-phone u can unlock phone from screen itself and in samsung touch phones this key is push button key not the sliding key
7 no outside music controls like pause/play,next
you have to unlock the phone for pausing or selecting new song
8 data cable provided with phone is too small
i have to buy aconnector for it to increase the length
otherwise your phone is hanging on desktop
9 audio quality when you use the headphones is not impressive even my 20$ 2gb mp3 player has better sound quality
even with higest volume and full bass you dont feel your head shaking
its just your hearing songs on it
without quality sound
8 3
2 inch screen size

its big but its not like i-phone i-phone's 3
5 inch has square kind of size
but 5800 if too long lengthwise and too short with wise
many time i think of returning the phone

 but i dont find any other phone in market which fulfill my reqirements

 i dont want to carry ipod and phone(two gadgets)
i dont want to pay 100$ a month for i-phone AT&T
 and nokia 5800 for only $299
think its good deal

 this phone needs a lot small changes


Overall I am pleased with this phone
 I have not used the applications feature that much
 Here's what I've noticed:GPS takes a while to lock in
 Forget about it inside
Had a few hangups at random times
 I'd say about 4-5 in 3 months
Camera - OK during the day, not so good at night
 I ordered another camera
 Video is OK too, once again during the day
For the price I got this on sale for versus how much cell phones cost locally, I have no buyers remorse
I know I need to update the phone software, and I am trying to figure that out
 I haven't really tried though

The only one thing I would say about this product is Nokia products are all awesome


especially the 5800 XpressMusic that I have been using
 I enjoy it every much

it helps me organize the works, arrange the time for school, relax and be entertained by all the funtions that this product have provided for me
 Nokia XpressMusic is the one subject that I always bring along with me every day from now

I really really love this smartphone
 It is intuitive and does everythig that is said about it
 The apps, are wonderfull and easy to navigate
 Nothing less should be expected from #1 cellphone maker (NOKIA)

Hi all
A couple of month ago I bought this amazing phone
First all buying in Amazon is always a great experience
 I live in Chile (far far away from you guys) and my orders always arrive at time and I can track'it in any moments
 Congrats to Amazon
About the phone
 I was thinking in buy N97
 I like the design, specs, it has keyboards


 but is too expensive
 Really is too much pay almost USD600 for that phone
 But the 5800XM have similars features but you pay half price

and It worht it in every dollarsReciently I added a 16Gb microSD class4 (also I bough it here in Amazon) and it works great
Some words

-Good build
 I'm afraid of plastic phone, but I'm impressed with this phone-Very fast 3G-Mail for Exchange
 I can sync with my company email
-Amazing screen resolution
 The movies and videos looks awesome
-A lot off apps in Ovi Store-The phone is fast, even with the 16gb microSD
 Well with the new firmware nokia raise the cpu clock to 434mhz (d'oh the same as n97)-If you know how take pictures, you'll find 5800xm camera excellent even in low light condition-The GPS is kinda slow but once is connected is delightfull
-The touchscreen is not the best at all is just resistive but it works better than my old LG Cookie
-The battery is a pain in




I think this is the main disadvantages
 With 3G and push email (with MS Active Sync <- very cool) and talking about 1 hour per day I must charge it every night
 Well is not a business phone, but come on

I don't even use it like a music player
Beside the poor battery life I recommend this phone
 You'll not regret it
But I'm waitting N900 ;)Best RegardsAlan Correa
The phone is quite good, but it could be better
Pros: Good screen resolution, good sound quality, nice headset
 Large storage space that is easy to interface with the PC
Cons: Graphical user interface not as friendly as IPhone and not as responsive since not using GPU acceleration
GPS is unusable, I never succeeded to get it to work
 Proprietary OS allows only signed applications to be installed

buen celular la mejor compra que hize lo recomiendolo unico malo es el gps se demora en conectarse pero el resto todo bien
This phone is great, I've been able to do everything with it
 Also upgrade micro Sd 8gb to 16gb and even better, for music, videos, pics, office docs

Muy buen equipo
 Pude descargar sin problemas todas las actualizaciones y luego configurarlo
 La configuración es un poco dificultosa ya que por defecto se conecta por la red de telefonia celular y en Argentina eso es todavia muy costoso
 Descargue el mapa para guardarlo en el telefono, pero no descarga todos los detalles y cuando salgo de la zona de wifi, intenta conectarse por la red celular
 Cuando cancelo la comunicación el mapa es muy incompleto
 Hasta el momento no pude hacer que descargue un mapa completo de por lo menos la ciudad de Mar del Plata
En cuanto a la calidad del equipo y del costo y de sus prestaciones es muy bueno
 Yo lo recomendaría a los posibles compradores, pero que tengan en cuenta que no es un telefono para un usuario con pocos conocimientos de tecnología

Great phone, unless it fails




 Nokia and their service agent apparently believe either your phone service is not important or you have multiple backup phones to use while shipping your phone in for repair numerous times


 Sent it back for the third time and they have had it for over a week




I was very excited when I found this phone and couldn't wait for it to come
 I wanted a reasonably priced smartphone that allowed access to the web, made phone calls, had gps, a decent camera, etc etc that was NOT an IPhone
 I'm just not buying the IPhone koolaid, having tried them a number of times, they don't excite me
 I just wanted a practical high-tech phone at a good price (with no contract) and this seemed to be it
 But it's not
Problem #1 is phone call quality using AT&T in the San Francisco Bay Area
 Your experience with another carrier in another area may differ, but this phone could not effectively make a phone call
 I'd dial out, get connected, and within seconds I'd lose the call, all while standing perfectly still
 I'd receive a call, answer it, and within seconds the call was dropped, or it would be dropped while it was ringing
 Out of a dozen calls that I made or received in the first day, I only had a satisfactory phone call 3 times
 Of those 3 times, the person at the other end said that always, every time, the sound was horrible and they could barely understand me, though I heard them well
 And just to prove that it is this phone, I took out the sim, put it into a cheap GSM phone I own, and I have great call quality, no dropped calls, and it works like a charm
 It's the phone (perhaps in conjunction with AT&T, but other phones work)
Problem #2 is dealing with WIFI
 I set up the wifi connection for the wifi in my house, putting in the passcode (which stupidly you need to do with a phone-pad keyboard)
 Then I'd go to the web browser and it would be using AT&T
 So, I found that there are 3(I think, maybe more) places you can set up this wifi connection, did them all, and somehow after quite a number of hours, I got it to use my wifi connection
 But



a few minutes later, I tried it again, and it asked me for my passcode for that network
 So I put it in again, laboriously
 Then an hour later I tried again, and it couldn't see the wifi network, even though I was 5 feet from the wireless router
 So, I turned off the phone, turned it back on again, and sure enough it finds the network, but it needs my passcode again
 This is not convenient
 In fact, it is not even usable
 I was never able to get this phone to retain the passcode to my wireless network for any length of time more than a few minutes over 2 days of trying
The new phone I received needed to have it's software updated
 I highly recommend you do that right away, as the new software is a vast improvement over the software that ships with the phone
 That said, it takes a long time to update
 And even though it is a vast improvement, the new software still has plenty of oddities, irrational quirks, and just plain weirdnesses that are too numerous to detail
 Their software development team badly needs a consistency control department
 Each application, or portion of an application works differently, with no consistency among them as to user interface and interaction
 It's a frustrating experience
 And although they improved the scrolling tremendously from the software in the device out of the box, it still isn't a good scrolling experience
The GPS was not nearly as accurate as my friends' IPhones
 I don't know why but my friends' IPhoness get me standing in front of my house as just that, me standing in front of my house
 This phone has me about 1/2 block down and across the street (or around the corner, or on the next street over)
 If GPS that is accurate to within 1 city block +/- is good enough for you, that's great, I don't think it will work for me
I've sent my phone back
 I can tell after just a few days that I'll never be happy with this phone
 It's a shame really, because by specification it is exactly what I want
 It just doesn't work as specified

If you are looking for an alternative to the ever-dominant Iphone, this Nokia is for you
 There is a great (though limited) app store, awesome mp3 set-up and nice touch screen keyboard
 My only drawbacks for this phone are that it is bulky and ATT's 3G service doesn't span as far as I need it (which isn't Nokia's fault)
 This truly is a great phone with the high quality reception Nokia is known for
And for those who are "directionally challenged" the maps app that comes with the phone got my husband from point A to point B with ease

A good phone with many functions that I like
 GPS is free and I can download whole world map on it
 Used for a few times, surprisingly good
 The only downside is locking GPS taks 2-3 minutes
 Touch screen works well
The biggest disappointment is that you can NOT make it to support other languages
 In my case I want it to support Chinese, if you buy this phone from US, you are out of luck
 The firmware that you can install is tied with country code of phone
 You can find some hacked firmware on internet, but you void your warranty
 I travel to China a lot, that means I can't use it there
 For people have similar needs, buy this phone from China local store

I am really impressed with this phone
 This is not an iphone so don't expect the features of an iphone
 The Name Nokia itself gives you the assurance that the phone has to be a good quality and it is
 The phone has great features like wifi, Very good camera (two cameras), touch screen, and many applications
 There is Nokia OVI Maps built in which gives you access to maps anytime even if your phone is not connected to internet
 You have to go online and download the maps for your state that you want
 It does have one month of GPS included
 The touch screen is not bad, but you sometimes have to use the tip of your finger as the area to touch are small
 Once you get the phone you have to update the software or else you will be having weaker scrolling and weaker touch sensitivity
 The update wasn't easy as the settings were all incorrect
 I had to Google the right settings before i was able to update
 The calendar is a good feature, but it looks like a weaker calendar compared to the previous versions of this phone
 The screen lock feature is great as it is on the side of the phone
 The phone is not really thin as it should be
 It does not have keyboards so you would expect it to be thinner
 The Sim card is very hard to remove as you have to remove the battery
 The memory card is very difficult to remove as well
 The music player is great
 The thing that i hate about this phone is while you are talking on the phone to a customer service and they ask you to press 1 for yes or 2 for no, you don't have keypad to enter that
 You have to go to options and open dialer to enter this
 This makes it difficult while dialing any customer service numbers
 Overall this a a very good phone with a lot of features and a trusted brand name
 The weakness is the touch is not too intuitive

Actually that is the second time that I buy this phone just to tell you that the item itself it really good
 I'm a iphone owner (for work and I still love this phone)
Interface as mentionnned in other reviews is not the best but definitely not the worse
 Take excellent pictures, friendly to use to movies purchased from Amazon
 Excellent with text
BUT the problem is Amazon did not ship me a new phone
 I found on the phone text from a previous owner
 I really upset considering that it does not say that it is refurbished or anything
 When I bought it it was 10 dollars more expensve than on the nokia site including shipping but as far as I always got a good service with Amazon I went with them
 Now I find out that the price droppes by 20 dollars to 240$
Again not a happy purchase

when i received the phone it seemed lovely but then we attempted to use the features
 the gps did not work other than giving us a map of our current location after a long period of maneuvering with those maps we finally got it out of latvia
 but the voice guidance never worked
 nor any directions
 when the phone rings it cannot be unlocked on the screen that tells you it is locked but rather must use the switch on the side and then tap the answer icon on the screen
 most of the promised applications were not available in the usa or canada only europe and asia
 the interface with windows programs such as office are no longer useable as the contract between nokia and microsoft is over
 the virtual keyboard does not open to enter automatically and the camera takes nice pictures but does not open easily and you must go through several steps between shots to save the picture and take another
 i thought that i was not able to figure out the proper use so brought it to a professional usability engineer who went over all the features and determined that the phone "sux" in her professional opinion
 am returning it

Shipping was very fast
 Phone is very nice but not so easy to learn
 You need to spend some time to be able to use it efficiently

Really good value on this purchase, this phone does a lot for a little price tag
 same specs as pricier phones like n97


 strongly recommended for basic use
plus:for the price has good featuresworks mostly finegood receptioncons:slow response timeno "alphabet" on dial pad view (hard to call for ex
 800-something kind of numbers)not acceptable:ON/OFF key stopped working so practically my phone is dead only in 12 monthsoften gets stock in vertical view (view does not flip by rotating the phone)
It is overall a great product
The signal is strong, the free GPS is great, the camera is excellent
The touchscreen keyboard is okay for me (small finger tips) but quite inconvenient for my husband
 The screen rotation is slow sometimes
One stupid thing is there is no alphanumeric dialer
 So when I try to dial a phone number given in the letter format, I have to decipher it by myself

good phone, lots of stuff on it to keep you busy
 speakers are good quality, and it has 3g
 you cant go wrong for the price of a touchscreen 3g phone
 sound quality is good, but the reason i gave it a 4 and not a five is that its hard to text from
 i do reccomend buying this product

First off, when I was looking for a basic (unlocked), no bells and whistle phone
 But couldnt find one that fit my needs
 (Purchased a supposed basic unlocked Motorola off Ebay, different story, but lesson learnt, don't trust Ebay)I have a new Ipod touch, so did really want apps, wifi and media
 But after being unsuccessful in a basic phone search, I thought about getting a full featured phone and eliminate my itouch
 After reading all the reviews about this phone and seeing the price of an Iphone (well out of budget), I decided on this nokia
Once receiving this phone, setting it up and with playing some java games on the device
 Upon using I immediatly realized that this phone is not even close to the same ballpark as apple products
Comparing this nokia to my itouch (pretty much a iphone), I began to notice that this phone is not as refined as apple options
1) The screen is a pain to use, even with the stylus, screen feels soft, not as sensitive and annoying
 It gets scratched easily, my ipod is 12 months old and not a mark to be seen, this phone is now 2 weeks old and has a few deep marks
 I have purchased protector to eliminate this
2) The apps and games available for this phone are terrible, I have downloaded 20-30 java games and apps for this phone and have deleted all but two
 Graphics, game play and entertainment on all games is terrible
 I have downloaded (not purchased) awful games from itunes, but then there are some great games
 The graphics of these java games remind me of my first ever gameboy and I would prefer to use the gameboy as the on-screen function of the nokia is crap
3) This phone has issues, it freezes at times and you get a solid blue screen, shutting down and a minute later and the phone is fine (happened twice in two weeks)
This phone is great as a phone (only as a phone), easy to use, great for contact detail, good battery life (3-4 days with minimal use, 1-3 with moderate)great sound for media/calls and acceptable Wifi
 For the price I think this phone has great value, it was one of the cheapest I could find with wifi, great for music and movies (forget games and apps)
 I travel a bit and basic phone Wifi is great to check emails and facebook at free hotspots
In the end I will keep this phone it does what I require, but I will still be keeping my ipod touch, its just so much more enjoyable to use
 My advice if you have/can justify the money get a unlocked Iphone, if not this nokia will suffice

I'll start with the good
 It has most of the stuff you would get in an iPhone for 1/5 the price
 Lots of apps, all the bells and whistles you'd expect on a modern cell phone like a camera and Bluetooth, etc
 Now for the bad
Either this phone or the software that runs it is extremely shoddy
 I can't tell you how often the phone gets completely locked up and the battery has to be removed in order to "reboot" it
 Since I bought my daughter's a week after my own, I have two of these devices to compare, and both have similar problems
 We have done firmware updates and factory resets
 One particular annoyance happens while you are typing a text message
In the middle of typing, the keyboard screen will momentarily disappear and then reappear
 Unfortunately, if you had been typing on the right-hand side of the keyboard at that time, you will have accidentally pressed a button such as the "send" button
 It happens about every 20 seconds, although it comes and goes
 I can't tell you how many times I have sent half messages because of this glitch, and it is the same glitch on both phones
 I don't have a single 3rd party app installed (although my daughter does), so it's not like anything is interfering
 I don't have it connecting to a WiFi network or any funny stuff
 Just plain texting
 My daughter does use all those other features, and they all seem to work OK, but what good is a smart phone that can do everything but text
The freezing problem has gotten so bad and I have needlessly missed so many important calls and messages that I am now shopping for a new phone
 I gave it two stars because it texts OK and plays music OK, and the camera and other features seem to work OK
 That's all it gets
 You should probably avoid this phone if you can help it

Ovi Maps can not be used on the Nokia 5800 as a free standing navigation system (offline mode), yet Nokia's press releases and Amazon's advertisement seem to suggest that it is possible
 In real life, to be able to use the phone as a GPS device independent of the service network is very important because there are times networks are overloaded - usually happen at the most inconvenient instances
 I hope Nokia will provide a fix

ok i just got this phone a few days ago so im not sure exactly how accurate this review maybe because i dont know how this phone will last
 I would have to say that i really do like this phone
 I was really impressed with amazon shipping, it came right on time

 Whats great about this phone is the touch screen is really user friendly
 I love the thing where it has the icons of your favorite contacts on the home screen (it accomodates for way more than 4 i think i have 7 at the moment
 I like the fact that it has a gps but you cant really use it unless you have 3g or your at home or something
 I like the fact that it has the button for the xpress music it has great shortcuts
 One thing i dont like about this phone is the fact that so far i have not found a way to but a security code on it (im paranoid about loosing my phone and have someone go through it)
 I dont like how you have to press the button like 3 time for it to actually start calling the contact
 I dont like how it doesnt change very well from landscape to portrait, i end up having to do it landscape alot of the time when i want it portriat
 Alot of features are kinda hard to access so you have to read to find out, you cant just pick up the phone and know
 I still havent been able to find out how to send a song or picture through bluetooth, but im sure ill find out
 Anyway, ill give an update later about how this all turns out but i really do think the phone is worth the money it may have some annoying aspects about it but you wont find a phone with all these features for that kind of price so if you want a nice phone and dont have a very large budget i would suggest this phone

It's a good phone, had it for nearly a year
 It has great features, easy access, and it works
 The battery life is pretty good for a smart phone
 Music sounds good and it has a radio which is awesome
 Free games, applications, and themes provided by the Ovi store
 Wifi is wonderful
 If you have no internet package the phone will make sure it does not accidentally use data
 However, it does freeze and glitch if you open two or more applications, or listen to the radio and text at the same time
 The screen has good resolution and display, but it could be bigger
 Texting is not bad but is hard as the buttons don't respond right away, or if you turn the phone horizontally its nearly impossible to text
 Sometimes the screen freezes as you are entering a text message and then picks up by dumping everything you've typed several seconds later
 Again, needs bigger screen and buttons
 Same with trying to dial a call- could be problematic
 The camera quality is excellent and there are many different options for editing your pictures and videos
 The call quality is good
 It's not a pretty looking phone, but it is unique
 It gives the "I really like it but not love it" feeling

Within two days phone started to die on us
 Would shut off after being fully charged
 Returned it in a week
 Would not recommend this phone

Had to say good bye to my old Palm Treo of many years
 The new Palm phones have not really kept up pace with the competition and it was time for something new
 After reading many reviews of many many phones, asking friends etc I finally settled for an unlocked Nokia 5800 (US version)
 I haven't regretted my choice for a minute
 Now in its 4th week, I am beginning to use it as a pro
 The only thing I can think of being a bit negative, is the screen response
 Sometimes it is a bit slow and I have to press again for it to react
 But that's all
 This was a great choice and I recommend it to anyone who wants a smart phone

I have had my nokia 5800 for a week now and it's definitely love so far
 The call quality is excellent and the speakers are top notch for a phone
 Everybody who has seen my phone has fallen in love with it's appearance (with the only detraction being it's thickness)
 It takes a little while to get acquainted with all the features and to learn your way around but once you do it's all smooth sailing from there

This phone is a good investment, I changed annually but this team used it for 3 years and it worked perfectly

this was the review i wrote initially when i gave it four stars


i spent a week online trying to figure out which smartphone i should buy
 i required an unlocked gsm phone that would receive the most common 3g bands as well as wifi
 i also wanted a decent camera
 i've never used a smartphone before and would have normally tried a few models
 only nokia had phones that filled my requirements
 i selected 5800 because it has the biggest screen and is the cheapest
 the phone performs my requirements fairly well
 it feels very clunky but since i've never so much as touched another smartphone, i have nothing to compare it to
 amazon service was excellent
the phone worked fairly well for first 100 days
 (curiously, the warranty was 90 days
) first, it stopped keeping time
 then every time i received a call, it would switch into another function so that the call ended up on voicemail
 thinking that it might have needed a software update, i tried to hook the phone up to nokia's pc suite
 in the past hooking up took anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour: it never worked the first try
 so i spent an hour and a half without any success
 i tried the support system in the past never with success
 i was able to find a way to send the phone back--i have extended warranty from amex
 but even if my phone would be fixed, i would still need to buy a new phone for the interim; moreover, i had no reason to believe the problems would be remedied
 instead, i decided to take out my frustration by badmouthing nokia every chance i get for the rest of my life
 no wonder that every other cell phone company is taking share from incompetent nokia

I used this phone for around 2 weeks and then decided to send it back
Good:It's a Nokia, so the calls were all clean and crisp
The form of the phone in my hand was exactly what I've been looking for
The screen is very bright and nice to look at
Bad:The OS looks like something you would have been using 3 years ago
 For the first try at a touch phone, it's pretty good but there are just too many other touch phones that have already got the OS right
The Ovi store is still not worth going to
 Only a few of the apps are even made for the 5800
 And most of those were just ported over from the original app to be used with the 5800
The camera should be better
 There is no excuse why a 3
2mp Nokia can't take a decent looking picture indoors
Overall I would say its a nice phone for the price but there are just too many phones out this summer to settle on this one
 However if you are buying a phone for your kids, this wouldn't be a bad choice

This is not a phone
 This is a PDA with a phone as an app
 It is just what I needed
 The only con is that third party apps have not yet caught up with this device, mainly a good ebook reader
 But eReader says they will have one that works on the S60 5th ed with touch screen ability by the end of summer
 Then this device will meet my main reason for buying it in the first place, only one device to carry instead of two, a phone and a PDA

This phone works great I get reception in places my Sony Ericsson didn't
 Great sound and video/pictures
1 word of caution if you buy it from Amazon and try there Unbox offer for $50 worth free video downloads, I entered the promo activation code and was still charged for the video
 I emailed them 3 times on there help web page that said they answer usually in 12 hours
 Never got a response



I like the expression, "a Nokia is a real phone
" You know you'll get excellent RF and audio performance, and good battery life
 In the 5800 you get this and iPhone-like features
 I know the Symbian OS is a little older, but reliable and being improved with 3rd party apps soon to follow in great quantity

is an excellent choice if you are looking for a touch screen smart phone, I've had a phew touch screen phones in the past but this is the best one yet, the only thing that I wasn't 100% happy with is the camera is not a very good one when there is not much light, but the rest is fantastic, the different writing modes are the best, you won't even notice it's a touch screen, berceuse you can blast emails and SMS messages like with a keyboard cell phone

I love this little Nokia 5800 phone
 It's great
 It has a better signal than my old phones
 I love being able to get on the internet where ever I am without a computer (with added data plan to your phone plan)
 It's just a great little phone with everything built in
 I've always liked Nokia phones but this is the best one I have used yet
 Thanks Nokia

Amazon made me a Happy customer, everything went as planned
 Thx and looking forward to make business with you in the future

for the price you get a lot of features that are competitive with some of the more popular phones
 clear signal good pictures during the day
 pictures at night are a little fuzzy
 gps eats up battery
 3
5 g downloads the from the internet really fast and wi-if is pretty good
 with 16gb card can store a lot of photos, video and games
 just wish ovi had more apps

Just got this phone and honestly, I prefer this touchscreen over others
Browsing the web though has left a lot to be desired as web pages don't display correctly
 Also my XP computer refuses to recognize this phone and the Nokia Updater won't run
 Amazon - where is the cute little stand that is supposed to be included
 I didn't get it

This is a great mobile, it's a good cost-benefit relation
Its battery is poorI'm happy with this

I could not be happier with the phone
 I am finding new uses for it every day
 It has quickly become an essential part of my life
 Really great features, well designed, quality product
Other reviews on here are very exhaustive, and I don't feel the need to keep repeating the same stuff
 I really have very little to complain about
Going from a SUPER simple "dumb" phone to this one, there is a slight learning curve (can't really dial without looking, because there are no buttons to feel), but overall, a great tool for me
The biggest letdown for me was the GPS
 I did not find it to be worth the monthly fee

After using this phone for awhile, I believe this is a very good phone with many features such as phone, internet, Camera, Gps
 who needs more from just a small phone
 All work well
 And it is a good buy

This is a great phone
 It isn't as high tech as an iphone, but its close to it with a cheaper price(without having to get a contract)
 It's a great smartphone and easy to use once you've played around with it
 I've added apps and themes to personalize it
 It's great and it comes with everything you need for your phone
 Plus you can hook it up to your tv

I bought this phone because i did not want to be caught in a 2 year plan with AT&T along with an additional $50 data plan for the iphone
 Despite the fact you can buy the dual sim card iphone fake in chinatown across the river was not an option
 Also when I do my international travel I can switch in my sim card and use the same phone
I must say I have discovered so many nice tricks and features with this phone the more I explore it
 I love the fact that you can put 5 of your closest contacts images on the main frame and simply press the pic to call, text etc
 I also assigned a ring tone to every person
 Phone call quality is awesome no one has ever complained they could not hear me and vice versa
 The volume I wished was a tad louder but that is being picky
 I love the headphones with the music controls there so you can ff or rew or even while listening to music you can get a call and the phone automatically turns off the music until you end the call
I love the GPS as well as the dictionary
 I am a traveler and I do a lot of crosswords on my travel time so having the dictionary was a nice discovery
 The versatility of the keyboard for tap, plectrum, mini, full qwerty as well as the handwriting makes writing notes or texting convenient
There is even copy, cut and paste
 I was able to record a phonecall for a return of a product so that if they said I did not call i can play the conversation as my proof
 I have used both cameras and the picture quality is great, the video feature is awesome as well
 I was able to assign a picture to most of my contacts from my pc as well using the very versatile Nokia PC Suite
 The ability to simply drag and drop any file including my music has really made a difference
 I also love the fact that on the phone you can edit your pics just like you would do on coreldraw or any graphic program
 I have added talk bubbles and designs to some of the pics
 You should see the one I did with my ex hehehehe


 Thankfully Amazon not only gave us the rebate( which I am yet to receive) but the videoondemand 50 credit
 I have so far bought mall cop and night at the museum pt 1 and downloaded to my phone
 I watched them recently waiting for my delayed flight last week using the nice stand that they gave me to hold the phone landscape style
The graphics on this phone is awesome the speakers are adequate and loud
 When I hooked the tv out cables from the phone to the tv it actually worked



 I was able to see slideshows of my pics on the phone as well as anything I did with the phone
 This phone is awesome
 I did play the tactile games, guitarrock, bounce and car racing cute but I am not a gaming person but they did keep me entertained
 Goshhhhhh there are so many other things on this phone but I will end on the music
 I SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO love this phone for the music
 I downloaded album art and 578 songs so far including my personal cds and I am loving it
 I have not been using my IPOD recently because I have the same songs, pics etc on this phone which is really neat
 I am really happy with my purchase but I wished the dialer had alphanumeric keys I wanted to call 1800 flowers and I had to call someone to ask them to look at their phone and tell me the numbers for flowers which SUCKED


 Otherwise I have not found anything bad with it
 Oh yeah









 one more thing I actually got a cover for the phone and I bought a reasonably priced 16 g microsd card because my 8 gb that the phone came with has 1
6 gigs left with all the stuff I saved on it

This phone is not reliable
yes you will say its not
But this phone hangs up if somebody will call you while you are surfing the net exampl watching youtube,sending message on facebook or chatting on fring
The bad thing about that the phone cannot recover by itself from hanging up and in order to revive this phone you have to manually remove the battery
SO HORRIBLE
i BOUGHT THIS CP BECAUSE IT HAVE IT ALL INTERNET,CAMERA,MUSIC AND PHONE BUT IT CANNOT HANDLE THE TASK
IMAGINE THAT CELLPHONE FUNCTION IS OFF IF YOU ARE USING THE INTERNET,

HUHUHU





I PAID 340 US FOR AND WORST I BOUGHT 4
i GUESS I HAVE TO HAVE THIS AS MUSIC PLAYER AND MID

Although it is not perfect, i'll give it five stars since it's one of the most complete cellphones in the market, specially considering the price
I'm pretty sure Nokia will improve the touchscreen sensibility for newer versions, since this aspect is the most relevant con if you compare it with a few competitors that perform greatly in this area
 Also, if it were a bit slimmer, it would be more appealing to iPhone consumers
I think the Nokia 5800 meets almost all the worldwide communication market demands on a cellphone: Good call performance (voice and video), 3G browsing capability, WiFi, expandable SD capacity (up to 16Gb), decent camera for picture and video recording, really nice and versatile multi-format audio and video player, and a great sinergy-friendly operative system
 Good enough to have no reason to put up with iPhone flaws
Although Nokia has a task to take this model to perfection in next versions, it already is a winning contender in the fully-charged multimedia phones
I highly recommend it to bowsing-tuneplaying-webchatting fans
However, not so much for online office-tool use
 This not an item to change your Blackberry for

GOOD
bueno
it was old model
One of the best phone I have
 Still working but I just bought smart phone to able to use better searching
 Thank you Nokia for a great phone
I bought this phone because I saw a friend had it and he did a good job selling the features
 I got the international unlocked version
 Plus this phone was used in Batman The Dark Knight movie
 Phone sold for $280 plus tax
What can I say, when I bought the phone over 5 years ago it was a good phone to use to browse the Web, watch videos and most importantly listen to music, that's were it shined
 Hence the name XpressMusic
 The phone had a good MP3 player as well as an AM/FM radio tuner that did a decent job scanning local stations when the antenna was attached
 The antenna was in the guise of Nokia's earphones
 Build quality of the earphones was poor though
 They fell apart after about a year of normal use
 Nokia used to be a great product 6 or 10 years ago along with Blackberry
 But then iPhone, Samsung, LG got into the market and made a superior quality product as far as the technology, design , build quality, ease of user use and application and customer support
 Nokia fell behind the tracks
 Could not keep up with the demands of the US market
 Nokia was good if you lived in Europe, Asia and Africa but not the Americas
 Issues with Symbian, lack of apps, memory and the fact that Symbian decided to bow out of the game and let Nokia look to Windows as an Operating System for their phones and tablets was a mistake in my eyes
 Strengths of the phone; Good build quality, durable, good battery, Music and media player and GPS
 Weakness; Symbian OS, lack of apps in Ovi Store, Stability of apps, would crash due to bugs in apps,security issues not enough memory,lack of Customer Support for Nokia and Symbian in Northern America

Perfect
I ordered this because the screen on my original 5800 was cracked
 It took, what seemed like, forever to arrive and isn't quite the same as my 5800
 So disappointed
 Wouldn't order from them again

excelente
My wife wanted the exact phone that had just died and this is it
 Happy wife

The very best phone ever

When I saw the ad for the video quality being better than a DVD I thought it was just plain marketing bluff, but upon getting this phone and watching videos on it it takes my breath away
 I always liked Nokia as a phone brand and they are the best in my eyes when it come to perfomance and durability
 The phone is light-weight for the size and slim and sleek (much better than an iPhone)
 The touchscreen is very responsive and the vibration when touched is pretty neat also
 The qwerty keyboard can be a problem for big fingers like myself so I just use the Alphanumeric Keypad (Options like this is awesome)
 Sound quality is great speakers a lil low for me but it must be me going deaf from the system in my car, but this phone is awesome
 I love it and I guarantee you will love it
Nokia 5800 XpressMusic Unlocked Phone with U
S
 3G, 3
2 MP Camera, GPS, Wi-Fi, and 8 GB MicroSD Card--U
S
 Version with Warranty (Black)
This is an excellent phone and MP3 player
 The camera operates better than the average cell phone
 I have had problems at call termination with the phone locking up which has required me to remove the battery as a solution
 As a touch phone, the 5800 is as good as any of the others that I have seen

Worked okay the first few days, but then the following problems slowly began:1) When I get a call, sometimes it beeps and vibrates like it's suppose to
 Other times when I get a call it does nothing until a few seconds later when it beeps to tell me I missed a call
2) When online, the browser will sometimes just freeze up or close without warning
 When it freezes up, sometimes the only solution is to pull the battery which sometimes causes all settings and information to be lost
 I have to back up the phone nightly for this reason
3) When my calendar alarm goes off, sometimes it will beep and vibrate like it's suppose to, other times it will just beep without vibrating
4) When my alarm goes off for a calendar event and I try to press either the 'snooze' or 'stop' button, sometimes the alarm won't stop
5) When I click on an event under the calendar, sometimes it opens the details of the event, but other times it opens a small window with the options of 'delete' or 'send'
6) When standing outside, the GPS may pick up satellites within a minute or so, but if I turn it off and try it again, it sometimes takes up to 20 minutes to locate the satellites again while standing in the same location
 I can stand in that same spot with my Garmin GPS and it will pick up the satellites every time within a minute
7) When opening a video on YouTube's desktop version, half the time, instead of playing the video, it just shows the flash player icon where the video usually plays
 (I tried deleting their latest application update and this seems to have fixed the problem
)8) Calendar events no longer show up on main screen
I went through 3 Nokia 5800's which all had the same problems
 Nokia's support was horrible
 They had me perform a hard reset and update the software on all 3 phones multiple times only to have the problems return after a few days
 After many calls, resets and updates, they told me to do it again
 I eventually refused and explained to them that performing a hard reset and updating the software was not a solution
 They said I had to then send it in to them for repair
 I reluctantly agreed
 When they returned the phone, I found out that their "repair" was to perform a hard reset and update the software once again
 Surprisingly, it didn't work
Amazon's support and return policy on the other hand was EXCEPTIONAL

I loved the way Nokia designed its first mobile touchscreen phone
 The purchase was a gift for my wife secretly
 She was impressed when she discovered the multimedia experience and web browsing it has
 Of course, the OVI share experience to upload all her photos and receive comments from her friends and family, was what made her happy
 This smartphone has everything required for a practical use of email, e-mail account wizards settings are very easily to use, and with the OVI suite you can have it all in one place
 Multitask System Symbian 5th Edition is really the strength of this model, which allows to do many things at once
 The only detail known is the battery consumption

This phone holds and manages everything for me, although some software wasn't included (mainly office apps i
e
 exel, word, ppt, pdf programs) for a small fee or sometimes for free you can download alot of business applications from the Nokia store (OVI)and other websites like Adobe; new applications come out to catch up with the phone's software version (S60 v
5); it's a great altervative if you don't want to be a an Iphone zombie j/k


it is responsive to small area touches like a finger nail or the stylus
 It doesn't do well with your whole finger unless the icons are bigger
 I surf the web and listen to radio (yes an FM radio is on the phone)at the same time
 It has a 3
5 mm headphone jack
 It has several keybords you can switch between which is handy for switching between entering passwords and typing a text message
 Some pics don't display in the browser but the browser that comes with it is pretty well thought out I think updates will come as time goes on and it's rare something doesn't display but it was something i noticed
 I have the Black phone and it is very sleek and attractive
 I am happy with my purchase don't believe I over spent and may actually save in the long run by it being unlocked (I didn't have to purchase a more expensive plan, like with I phone)

super long battery life, clean live sound from speakers, easy to use display and on-screen keyboard
 Letter recognition works
 Cons: no real keyboard

Don't look anywhere else
 It's got everything you want from a smartphone
 Great purchase
 I'm very, very satisfied

Firmware updates for the 5800XM seem to come every few months and the system automatically reboots after but there is also a soft reboot and a hard reboot if needed
 I have not used either
 For my purposes, mostly music, appointments and alarms, and the phone, it is stable with just 1 exception when the battery overheated while I was talking on the phone and connected to my Wi-Fi
 This has not happened again
Kinetic scrolling is what most XM users are waiting for in the next upgrade because current dragging scrolling is not as accurate and is inconsistent depending on what app or utility you are using
 The bad news is that the kinetic scrolling will only be for the home screen, contacts, and the browser
 I don't think the dragging currently used in the 5800 is all that bad but there is a learning curve if you are not use to it
The browser is slow and sometimes hangs but anyone using the internet knows that sometimes any browser, including FireFox will hang
 This is really not specific to the 5800XM
 When it stops responding I do the same thing I would do on my laptop or PC, change to something else I was doing and wait for the browser to either respond or I kill it
 With the 5800XM simply click on the menu button and get out of there
 I have never had to reboot because of the browser
 It is, however, slow
 I have full AT&T 3
5G coverage (7 bars) but the browser still works faster over Wi-Fi
 Response time is supposed to increase with the new firmware
On icon screens the 5800XM requires only a single tap to open but on some of the menus 2 taps are required
 That is real confusing until you get use to it
 The upgrade may fix this as well
Supplied documentation is basically non-existent other than for just general operating instructions but there are tips and hints tutorials on the net
Outside, the camera takes crystal clear pix
 Inside takes a little tweaking but there are plenty of options
 The new firmware is also supposed to contain a camera enhancement
The auto-orientation screen rotation sometimes gets discombobulated but corrects itself in a second or so
 Some screens don't rotate but this is addressed in the next release as well according to the Nokia USA discussions forum
The speaker distorts sound if it is set at max but although I would expect better from a phone advertised exclusively as for music, it is typical of almost anything I have had plus I usually have on the earphones so the sound in not on max that makes this mostly a non-issue for me
There is built in Flash player but it does not work with version 9 so some of the videos you want to watch online simply won't play until this is upgraded in the firmware
Mine and some others have a small open area on the top right side where the top screen section of the phone meets the main phone section
 You can see it real good if you hold the top of the phone against a white background, look along the side and front and between the 2 black sections
 It almost looks like someone took the phone apart and did not put it back together correctly
 Dust and even hair can get below the screen
 I keep the phone in my pocket at all times so I don't see where this will be an issue and after 2 months, it is not
 If it becomes an issue, I will have to ship it to a Nokia Care center so I kept my other Sim-card phone just in case
The issue with earlier European phones that involved a defective ear speaker is not an issue with mine
I had trouble connecting to my home Wi-Fi but once I upgraded my router's firmware, the XM found it without further incident
The GPS turn-by-turn directions through Navteq and Nokia Maps are flawless and the phone comes, if I remember correctly, with a 3 week free trial
The battery life is about the same for any other phone I have had and even better seeing as how I am always listening to music
So, why did I stay with this and not go with the iPhone 3GS
 Every phone and every OS has some issues
 This is really the first attempt by Symbian at a touch interface and they seem responsive to enhancement requests
 I did not want to get locked into a contract in case I move and can't get the AT&T signal
 I don't make or take calls every day so I did not want to pay the minimum monthly for the iPhone
 I use Pay as Your Go
It has tactile as well as visual feedback (the key you press enlarges and there is a slight vibration that you can turn off), making typing on the large QWERTY easy and the XM remembers where I use the large keyboard and automatically brings it up with the apps where I use it
 It is just the right size and the rubber-like back makes it easy to hold on to
 The XM has both primary and secondary cameras
 It backs up to both its own folder on your PC as well as synchronizes with my Outlook Express
 Also, for all music lovers, the surround sound in the 5800 is the best I've heard on a phone
Some of these things would have totally turned off most people but I searched for over 2 years for a better alternative to my Sprint Palm and the 5800XM is the only phone that fulfills all my needs
 The enV Touch came close but it has no Wi-Fi and I could have been locked into monthly fees and a contract
 I am willing to put up with a few minor inconveniences while they iron out the bugs
 I would not have been happy at all with the alternatives and it is the best phone I have owned
Update 10-16-09 the browser freeze does not happen since I reoriented my Wi-Fi
 Version 3 update still not available through PC Suite
 Most times Bluetooth works flawlessly but sometimes, under exactly same circumstances, it constantly cuts out and this is reported from people using different BT devices

Absolutely, without a doubt - great phone
Most importantly, it has WiFi


 You can always switch between cellular and WiFi and that's a huge money saver


 I'm on the 'pay as you go' (AT&T) type of plan, which is the most convenient way for me to stay connected, when I want to be


 Having a regular cell phone plan for me personally, is not an option - I hate to be 'on the leash at all times'
 Can't wait when Nokia releases Skype edition for 5800
 I know it's coming
 Battery life is awesome 


 three days, always ON and still going
 In spite what other people say about cheap looking, made in China and all that - I totally disagree
 There's nothing wrong with its looks
 Navigation's pretty simple and easy, unless you have banana shaped fingers

 Other benefits: 8Gigs micro SD card (up to 16
), headphones, strap and stand, USB cable, charger, etc
Reception's quite well, but it's all about the area where you live in, I assume
 Haven't tried it as a GPS device yet, though
 Check out Ovi Nokia Store too
 Great apps for whatever you need

I was very unsure about this phone when my husband ordered it for me because he is very well know ledged with technology
 I am not to say the least
 But everything on the phone is very user friendly and organized
 It just makes sense
 I love the touch screen
 You know exactly what you want to enter, unlike the iphone that I found uncontrollable compared to this phone
 I really like it, everyone may not but I have had it over a month and it has been great

Pros:- The set up was fairly easy and straight forward
 Insert an AT&T sim card and it was able to figure out various network setup(internet/MMS/Message) automatically
- Touchscreen was responsive and pleasantly easy to use- Price/feature is good compared with other models- Battery life seems to be quite decentCons:- Even though I didn't install much additional applications(nightstand + Opera browser), it kept generating this error "memory card full


close some application" message even when I was simply composing an email message(Messaging)
 The phone comes with 81MB memory and 8GB card and it should have tons of space left
 I googled around and looks like this might be a known problem with 5800
 You may have to turn it off and back on to get around the problem but this error happens once every few hours
 Not good
- In addition, unlike its competitors, it is unable to render CKJ language(lack of unicode support
)
 Looks like the only way to get around this is to fake the product code, and use some freeware to flash it with some older version of firmware(which supports whatever language you desire)
 This most likely will void the warranty so that's not good
I'll work with Nokia support to see if we can resolve the memory full message problem
Update: I called Nokia support and they basically told me to get a replacement since the "memory full" message indicated mine was a defective unit
 Got a replacement, but the new unit somehow freezes frequently for 15 or 20 seconds at a time
 One time it hangs completely and I have to remove the battery to restart it
 A few times the gravity sensor stopped working (doesn't alternate properly between portrait & landscape mode) also
 It is a very good phone but unfortunately too buggy
 :(
Well where should I should I begin, its great touchscreen phone comes with a memory card (8gb)so you can download music and movies if converted to the right format settings
 The screen looks beautiful
 I don't usually buy phones unless something innovative has been created
 For Example This will be my 3rd cell phone ever my first Nokia 3560 phone without a camera, second LG Cu500 has a camera and music player and 3rd Nokia 5800 Wifi, touchscreen watch and listen to media on the go
 All mechanics works great no problems
 The only bad thing about it is the battery little short if u keep using it for wi-fi
 I recommend waiting for a good price on amazon this phone price keeps going up and down during different days
 So wait for it

It works great and is quite useful, I use it as a business cell phone
 Bur remember you get what you pay for, 5 stars is for the fact I paid such a low price and it is what it is
 The only issue I have with it is start up and shutting down problems, EVEN ON THE FIRST DAY
 But just take out the battery for a second and put it back in and its all fine again
 If it was a little more expensive, I would have given it 4 or 3 stars

I have been eyeing this phone for months watching for a price break, which finally happened last week
 On top of that great deal, I am going to send my phone to Nokia Trade Up For Cash program, which means overall I have spent $200 on this really cool phone
I had Nokias my whole cell phone history and last year got a Motorola
 I really did like my Z9 but it was almost obsolete from day 1 (but I really don't have anything bad to say about it, it was a good phone
) I missed Nokia with their simple menus and excellent quality
To be honest, the menus are no longer simple and sometimes seem counterintuitive LOL
 And the touchscreen is a bit hard to use with the fingers like touching an iPhone (I have an iPod Touch so I was waffling between this phone and the iPhone)
 The touchscreen works very well with the included styli though
 And my learning curve is getting better with touch, so I don't see it being a problem after a while
 I think the accelerometer is faster than my Touch, almost too quick sometimes
 The Music Player is the bomb
 Way louder than my Touch and perfect clarity
 It sounds amazing
 I don't even need an additional speaker like I need for my Touch
The screen is gorgeous and so far setting up everything has gone well
 I have my music transferred, my contacts transferred and am very happy
 I like the compact size and heft of the phone
 I don't like lightweight feeling phones
 The camera seems fine to me
 The battery life does seem to be on the shorter side but make sure you close web applications after use
 The phone does so much that you can dejuice it quickly
 My Touch does the same thing
Nokia definitely needs to step up with apps and also get the Music Store available for the US
 Also if you message the downloads to yourself it is a pain, so it is better to download on the phone direct from the store
 The App selection bites though, but that's what my ipod is for
 The thrill of app-ness dies down anyway, so it's not really a big deal, but not having music store access is just silly
Otherwise this phone is very competitive to iPhone
 Being upgradeable with its memory is a definite plus and you can even have many memory cards since it's hot swappeable, technically that is unlimited memory
 I love my Touch of course but I got an 8g and I'm maxed out with music and apps and now I can't do anything to it unless I get rid of stuff
 That kinda bites
 So the 5800 has a true edge there
I already had AT&T and it was no problem to pop my SIM card in the phone and move right along
 I had everything except the TV out cord and the stand which it appears on the website that they do not sell that in the package anymore so that is more Amazon's fault for not upgrading the info, but I don't really need the stand or cord
 The USB cord is entirely too short
 The headset comes in 2 pieces with a piece that can control the music and phone, which is very nice
 Of course the charger is included and is acceptable
 It easily connected with my internet, easily paired with my bluetooth, and once I finally figured out how to transfer music from my ipod to it, there were no problems there
I am very pleased with this phone and would recommend it for people who want a quality touchscreen phone and not necessarily an iPhone
PS I LOL at 8g holding 6000 songs
 Maybe 6000 ringtone sound bytes
 8g will net you between 600-800 average songs




I have been using this phone for 5 months now, is great, the greatest feature is the GPS, sometimes is slow to connect but is pretty accurate
 The web browsing is also great and fast, depends on the connection, I have not downloaded many applications, word and excel work fine and are good for working or having information on the go
 The sound is excellent in voice calls, and in music mode
 All in all I like the phone, highly recommended

This is a great phone that has a multitude of functions and features
 This is a good alternative to the iPhone
 It is one of the best phones from Nokia

I do not usually write reviews, but I like this phone so much that I felt I should write one
 First, I normally would not buy a Nokia - I am a Sony Ericsson fan
 However, I needed a quad-band phone for a trip to Europe and I wanted a touch phone
 The SE Satio has been released, but not in the USA and it is pricey
 So I went with the Nokia
 I love the look and feel of the phone
 I have had absolutely no problems - no screen freezing and battery life has been very very good
 The battery charges quickly
 It is easy to lock and unlock the phone manually
 There is an automatic lock feature which you can disable or set a longer time before it automatically locks
 Calls are easy and call quality is great
 A prior reviewer said it is to hard to make a call, but I do not find that to be the case
 You can put pics or an icon for people you call frequently (I think up to 5) on the start screen or set up a speed dial number
 I find it easy to use the touch screen but you do need to apply some pressure - more than the iPhone, but it works great
 I am not a big web user but it connects quickly
 I have not tried the GPS yet
 I do have to say the camera is not so great, so if you are looking for a good camera phone I would not buy this phone
 Also, I do not know why the phone icon is found in applications and not on the main menu (maybe I can change that)
 I am still learning to use all of the many features this phone has to offer
 If you are looking for a reasonably priced phone with lots of features, you should definitely consider the Nokia 5800

Hi I bought this phone 
 But even I couldnt use it for 1 month
 I was not in Us to return with in 30 days
 And warranty covers only 10 days
 You sholuld know this
 Plus i cant find the number to contact with celler
 The phone even couldnt open it , it was not fall down anything, by it self it start to not working
 I am so dissappointed with this situation and I do not know what to do, Who can I speak with
Seda Alpat
I currently live in Nicaragua and I had seen this phone on the market however it was extremely expensive ($480 aproximately) however for some reason I looked it up on amazon and it was a great surprise when I saw it was nearly $200 less here So I decided to buy it and I must admit I was a little scared to do so but I was greatly surprised when I finally got it in my hands, I had it sent over however the person who received it over there loved it as well and was surprised when he got it before the expected date
 the features are really cool and I've had no problems with the phone
 However there is one thing, My charger doesn't work
 There I was using the phone after supposedly charging it all night and it dies and I was concerned, however My best friend has a Nokia and lend me her charger and it worked just fine thank god hehe and also the battery life is pretty good I think, at least in my case, it's lasted more than 2 days before completely dying and I have been using it a lot b/c I'm still transfering contacts and other stuff
 I love the display and the only thing i don't like too mcuh is the writing panel cuz I like to use the small one and it's a little hard to get every letter straight however the big one is very spacious and nice
 the camera quality is pretty good, I had a motorola a1200 before and although it was a 2
0 px camera the quality was amazing so I was worried that this one was not gonna be as good even though it had better resolution, but it's turned out real good
 I would definnately recommend this phone
the telephone arrives me under very good conditions (NEW SEALING IN ITS BOX) the excellent software works well in venezuela with the company movistar all its functions up-to-date mail, msn, facebook, wi-fi, everything very well, but what I don't find well is that not all the accessories were in the box I lack the tv cable and the base to place the telephone: (that hurtsNOTICES: the battery doesn't last but d 7 hours that is very bad


As somewhat of a tech-head with an eye for detail and quality, I had searched widely to find a smartphone that offered the best blend of features and quality without breaking the bank
 The Nokia 5800 honestly impressed me, though not so initially, but after a couple weeks of usage it has the tendency to grow on its user offering a solid and sleek feel, gorgeous display, and outstanding audio (the audio is really that good, through speakers and earphones alike, especially with stereo widening enabled, it is truly an experience)
 In addition, the touch-enabled Symbian OS (even though it is still maturing) is quite responsive and provides a user friendly experience
 What I can say is that the UI was designed with the correct balance of animation and snappiness (animation effects are turned off by default, activate them through Themes > General > Options > Theme Effects)
 If the UI is not that eye-catching for your taste, there are thousands of themes you may download and apply, in addition you can even design your own theme through Nokia's Carbide
ui software (downloaded separately)
 What's more is the variety of apps available for the phone, I can recommend a few that I have found quite useful: Photo Browser, Handy Shell, Paint Pad, Phone Torch, Opera Mini, AccuWeather, QuickOffice, GoogleMaps and Fring
 (google them to find out more)Another aspect that truly impressed me is the phone's ability to act as a mini entertainment system
 Bundled with the package is a certificate which allows you to download $50 worth of movies from Amazon
 I got six movies (both hi-def and mobile versions) for this price and they all fit on the 8 Gigs of hot-swappable storage that comes with the phone
 In viewing the movies on the phone I was impressed at the display quality (16M colors, 640x) and more so with the audio quality - the stereo speakers were loud and rich, able to simulate the acoustic depth of the movie and I must say that it rivals some laptop speakers I have come across
Another highly important aspect is the battery life
 For the first few days of owning the phone, it was constantly used, testing out the Camera, GPS, Wifi, playing movies, installing apps, etc
 and with such constant use (which is unusual for a typical user), the phone was able to operate for a full day and a half before the battery warning kicked in
 Now I charge the phone every three days or so with a few daily calls, light web browsing and YouTube playback
 (A tip for you is to make sure you fully charge the battery with the phone off when you get it initially, it operates and keeps it charge as it should this way)
The phone's camera is quite decent in my opinion
 It shines in daylight conditions able to capture great photos and widescreen videos of surprising quality
 In low light conditions, you may have to play around with settings a bit and get as close to the subject as possible to get the best possible result
 Overall, the phone's camera could be better given the quality of cameras on previous Nokia products, namely the N95, but this judgment is relative
 I believe, however the choice was made to make it affordable, given the fact that it also comes with a front-facing camera for video calls
Final thoughts and tips about this interesting piece of hardware center on its value, quality and reputation as a Nokia branded product
 Some say it rivals the iPhone, and honestly, it does have more collective strengths as a smartphone than does the iphone in spite of its resistive and non-glass touch interface
 It even has a downloadable simulation of the iPhone's interface called MyPhone if you prefer that flavor
 In this light, the phone shines as a more flexible device with swappable memory, battery and service, features not present in the lauded iPhone, but I say what's to compare
 In short I chose this phone and adore it now due to its form-factor (not too big, not too small), its screen, its expandability and flexibility, its hardware features (GPS, Wifi, audio) and most of all, its competitive price/quality ratio

OK

to start, I gotta say that the FREE shipping from Amazon SUCKS
 So, if you want good shipping, dont use the FREE shipping that Amazon offers
 Why
 Tracking is horrible, tracking history is completely inaccurate
(I used the nokia N82 before)IF YOU REALLY WANT TO BUY THE CELLPHONE, READ THIS REVIEW
 I THINK IT WILL HELP A LOT
 IT IS LONG, I KNOW
Moving on, the cellphone is good for the price
 Come on, where will you get a 300$ cellphone that has all the functions that this one has
 It is insane: 3
2 camera, touchscreen, more customizable than iphone, external memory, etc etc
Regarding the touchscreen


I think it is personal taste

 I never used the iphone, and I think that this touchscreen it is VERY responsive
 AFTER buying this phone and getting used to it, I used a friend's Itouch and I gotta say that my nokia 5800 is the winner
 But as I said, it is personal taste
 Still, it is a very responsible touchscreen (no matter you say that it is a resistive touchscreen)

like, you got no excuse

it is responsive, and it is responsive
 PERIOD
Good things about it:-Starting to have more apps


you just gotta know where to find, for FREE
-MACRO of the camera is awesome
-I got the GPS with turn by turn voice direction (trial), and it is a dream
 I wont know when they take away my trial


however, with voice direction, this thing it is a real GPS
-The media button is pretty useful
-It is legit that it unlocks when you take it close to your face when you are talking
-Speakers are also awesome
 Super loud
 Sound quality when you plug in earpieces are also really nice
-I love the cable to plug it in to the tv
 I convert videos, put it on my cellphone and lay on my bed, plug the cellphone into the tv and voila
 It is REALLY nice
-About apps
 Right now I have 42 but I only use maybe 8 of them lol
-The screen it is mega-clear
 It is one of the best screens ive seen
The "so-so" of this phone:-Build quality
 It is pretty well built, however the screen it is TOO plasticky
 When I put it under the sun, the reflection shows a big difference in the surface, I mean

it is not completely flat
 Using the reflection of light you will realize it is not completely flat
 In other words, the screen presents big flex (like in laptops, for instance)
 However, the rest of the cellphone is well built
 If you take out the screen part of the cellphone, it is a pretty solid cellphone
-The camera
 I dont know
 Sometime it takes great pictures, sometimes it stinks
 When there is too much suns, it doesnt work well
 When there isnt light, it also sucks
 It has to have the right amount of light
-For some people it may be ok, but this is a freaken fingerprint magnet
 only the back cover it is mate
 The rest of the cellphone devours fingerprint as a dinasour
-Battery life it is not the best, but not the worst
The bad:-The interface it is not the friendliest
 It could be better
 I hope that with the update, it will be user friendlier
-The screen
 As I said, it is too flexible
 It kills me to see differences with the reflection of the light (you know what im saying if you have the cellphone)
 It makes me hella nervous
-Sometimes the phone in landscape mode, when you want to scroll down or up for example in some setting, it is freaking hard
 I always keep tapping the wrong thing
 in vertical mode this doesnt happen, because the scroll bar it is sticked to the right of the screen, so you dont have margin of error
 however, in landscape mode the scroll bar is in the middle of the screen, so it gets tricky
-Honestly, the phone it isnt the best looking phone in the market
 It is just a chunk of plastic
 (This is for people that care about appearances
 I personally dont care, but im trying to be objective)Ok, I think this is pretty much it
 If you read this, you may decide whether to buy ir or not
 I think it is a pretty good phone for the price
 If you are RICH and money it is not your main problem, I would say go buy yourself a N97
 Oppositely, I would say definitely go for this cellphone; I like it pretty much
 You wont regret it (however, remember all the things I wrote in this review)
 If you are ok with the cons of this cellphone, you wont regret
 And in my opinion, the Pro's overcome the Con's so


 I dont know, it is your call
I hope this helped

I decided to pick up an unlocked phone to go with my AT&T service rather than go into another 2 year contract
 After months of deciding on IPhone or something different, I came to the conclusion that the missing features of the Iphone were too much for me
 I needed multi-media messaging, video recording capabilities and a better camera
 I also wanted the ability to change batteries at some point as I've had bad luck with devices that had built in batteries
 So I ruled out Iphone and went on a search for the perfect phone
 While I can easily say that there is no such thing as a perfect phone, the Nokia 5800 comes close
 I was going to wait until the N97 was released but the $600 or $700 price tag was too much to take
 I ended up buying the 5800 from Amazon at a reasonable $302 which was the same cost as the 16gb Iphone minus the 2 year contract
What I like about the phone:1
 It has everything I need that the Iphone was missing including very good video recording capabilities
2
 The Bluetooth works well with my car and head set
 No difference in sound and everything is very clear
3
 Music Player is clean and clear but it could be a bit louder
4
 Web browsing works well although not as smooth as the Iphone5
 Flash support



 Yes, you can watch youtube videos on it6
 Amazon On Demand $50 gift certificate - While I don't see myself using the phone to watch movies, this was a nice treat and it looks very sharp on the screen7
 Battery life is great compared to other phones that have these features and can be replaced8
 Access to any type of e-mail including Exchange support9
 The full digital keyboard is easy to use with the stylus (a bit tough for those of us with fat fingers
)10
 Ability to use apps such as QIK which allows you to stream video for live sharing (very cool feature)11
 Customer support from Nokia has been top notch for me12
 Expandable memory - comes with 8GB card and I expanded it to 16GB
 I've heard through the grapevine that it can also handle the new 32gb SD cards that just came outLast but definitely not least13
 Multi tasking
 Listen to music while tracking your fitness and browsing the web
 No problem



well except for the actual working out part
What I think needs improvement1
 Camera takes incredible pictures in bright light but is brutal in low light situations
 Supposedly firmware V
21 helps this problem but it is not available in the U
S
 yet2
 Limited Apps available compared to Iphone
 Not a big deal but it would be nice if Nokia can get their App store up and running beyond the limited themes and music tones out there right now3
 Firmware Updates - U
S
 versions seem to be last on the list since no major carriers over here carry this phone
 Waiting for V
21





4
 Touch screen is fairly responsive but could use some additional customization for sensitivity5
 There is a learning curve for the Symbian software that runs the phone - Not as intuitive as the Iphone but once you get the hang of it is not too bad6
 Web browser - yes, it is one of the things I like but it also has some flaws with navigation
 Iphone got this one right and no one else has gotten closeOverall, in my opinion, this is one of the best phones on the market under $400
 I think the N97 coming out will be the king of phones but I doubt it will break into any major U
S providers since it would compete directly with Iphone, Storm, Pre, etc


 It's too bad for Nokia that they are left out and that means too bad for U
S owners of their phones since we get all the newest firmware releases last (if at all)
 I don't see myself changing phones anytime soon as the 5800 seems to have everything I need for now
 Maybe if 4G or 5G or whatever is next on the horizon becomes available, I will consider changing
 For now, this is my choice
*****Update May 27, 2009*******Great news

 The Nokia App store is now live (store
ovi
com)
 I now feel like I have a complete phone as I can easily download apps and have them installed
 Prior to yesterday, the only way to get apps was to search for them on various sites, forums and other places
 The installs were always hit or miss and I could never tell if the app was compatible with the 5800
Now, with the new app store, I feel like the one thing missing has been fixed
 The number of apps seems to be very large upon the initial opening
 I heard that something like 20,000 apps were supposed to be released on launch day but there is no easy way to know how many are really out there
Prices seem a little bit higher than the IPhone store
 There are a good amount of free apps but the ones that cost money seem to range anywhere from $2
99 to $20
You can either shop the store on your computer and send a text link to you device or you can download the OVI app which will automatically connect you to the app store
Hopefully the amount of GOOD apps that are released will increase fast now that the store is open
 In my mind, the only benefit of the IPhone was the apps


but that it now in the past
Oh, and it seems like us U
S owners are getting abit more support
 The App updater works now and I was able to update to the newest version of Flash Lite which could only be done in the past through firmware updates
 And speaking of firmware, I haven't checked to see if V
21 is available in the U
S
 yet but tech support seemed to goof up a bit last week when they told me to download it to fix a minor issue I was having
 When I told them I couldn't see the update, they quickly corrected themselves and told me to keep checking
 So hopefully any day now

Finally, I love this phone so much that I just picked up a second one for my wife
 With the $50 rebate, that puts the price to below $300 which is just amazing compared to what the IPhone would cost coupled with PDA monthly data charges
 The 5800 is the winner

I recommend this to any who want a Phone which is NOT the i-phone but has all the functionalities
 It is also very configureable, I can install many apps and the screen is great

Even though this is first Nokia touch-screen experience, it's not bad at all


 has almost everything you'd like to have in a smartphone, but they have changed slightly the interface so it's a little different from what you would expect from Nokia


The PRO's: Great resolution, camera and sound; integrated wi-fi; good memory capacityThe CON's: Poor capacity to arrange the menus as you wish; no easy use of the touch screen as Palm-like graffity
 Not intuitive interface
 Lacks integration with contacts and e-mail (have to work them separately)
So


 buy it or wait till next upgrade or model
 ;)
This is my first touchscreen phone, but i'd tried some before, and I really like the way it responds
 The screen resolution is awesome and the aplications works very well

This cellphone is great the sounds is great
 The micropohone is amazing
 I never thought that even this small can give a sound like that
 The touch screen is also nice or should I say tap screen and there are times that it takes a little while before it responds
 Overall its great and would definitely recommend it

I've had this phone now for a little over a month
 I can tell you that after using it for this length of time that it is an excellent phone
 It can do more than any other touchscreen phone out there today
 The only two phones that can even come close are the iPhone 3G and the BB Storm
 This phone can do more than either of them two
 The camera gets dogged a lot, but in all actuality, it does a pretty good job when taking pictures in bright outdoor/indoor light
 The front facing camera is an outstanding feature and works very well
 The Video (which iPhone does not have at this time) is very exceptional as well; even more functional and better quality than the camera still shots (odd eh
)
 The virtual qwerty is very nice and has all the keys in the right place
 I also have an Eternity, but the layout of the 5800's keyboard is way better (don't make me dig for my apostrophe Samsung
) >:[
 Also, the haptic feedback is awesome too
 The vibration actually 'feels' localized and not just vibrating the whole phone
 The call quality is top notch, not sure why some reviews say other wise, but compared to previous phones I have owned, this was on par with my old Nokia E51, and better than my Eternity, Quickfire (what a joke), SE w580i or LG Vu
 I've had other phones too, but they were very basic phones and were also Nokias
The OS is still a tad bit immature, making its crossover to the touchscreen
 However, it is still very stable and functional for its 'immaturity'
 I love how they managed to keep all the previous capabilities of the S60 3rd and include it into a very well packaged bundle what is now called S60 5th Edition
 I love the 'tap and hold and slide' to copy and paste things
 It is so awesome
Syncing is great as usual
 I downloaded the iSync plug from Nokia website and was able to sync my calendar and contacts via bluetooth flawlessly
 Also, PC Suite worked like a charm as with any Nokia phone
The sound is best in class
 I don't think anything out there can compete with the sound quality that this phone puts out
It's still a new phone, been out only about 7 months now
 But they provide excellent firmware support (3 to date) and are constantly looking for ways to improve performance and enhance any existing features if not, they even add more useful features
As for all the other features (gps, radio, messaging, browsing); it does them all very well
 I have no complaints
 Probably the only drawback if there were one, is the fact that this phone can do so much with its Symbian OS that you really need to read up and research all the things it can really do and how to do them
 This phone's OS has a very rich Symbian ancestry
It's an excellent phone and I honestly believe that this phone is best in class and overall compared to the other phones currently out there
 I would even go so far as to say I am glad I did not wait for the N97
 I know blasphemy
 But it's true
If you get this phone, you will not regret it
 Just keep in mind that it does come with plenty of features and the OS is very 'sophisticated'
 Oh, by the way, I do have to admit, that it is very nice to have a 'Smart Phone' that can use the internet and check email without having to pay any PDA fees
Kudos Nokia
 Keep it up

I was sorry to see that what could have really given the iPhone a run for its money is actually trailing


Here is what I liked:1) Great sound
 For a phone, the full body sound from its stereo speakers was amazing
 Great for music, and as a speaker-phone
2) The size - fits very nicely in the hand
 Body is plastic - but feels solid
3) Fastest GPS initialization I have ever seen in a portable 'period' let alone a phone-gps
4) Great video playback
5) Loved the handwriting recognition
Here are my dislikes:1) The Phone user interface is lacking
 Especially if you use systems that require DTMF tones to operate
 There were several occasions when even after getting the soft dialer on the screen, the digits did not send out the tones - on other occasions it did - I was not able to figure out what I was doing differently to get consistent behavior
 The phone had to go back because of this
2) Applications just suck up power - if you use the phone for more than th e phone, you'll run short
3) Application hangups - podcasts downloaded caused the media player to get stuck
 Had to cycle power to restore
4) Email application does not support HTML
5) No flash player6) WiFi selection is stupid


 it does not automatically pick known wifi when in its proximity


7) Feels the phone could use more horsepower
I'm waiting for the N97


Cheers

This smartphone may surprise you

 The touchscreen is sensitive and is responsive to data input which I didn't expect for a resistive design
 Handwriting recognition works well and you can train it to your style
 Very fine resolution on the display with saturated colors
 Great WLAN (wifi) connections -- works better than my PC
 3
5G on AT&T's cellular network is rather fast
 Impressive loudspeakers on voice calls which is something I find valuable
 Good sound quality on voice calls
 Loundspeakers also work in stereo for music playback
 Have not fully tested GPS yet -- not sure how well it works
 'Net browser fully renders web pages including Flash animation
 One feature that would have been nice is a trackball but you can swipe your finger to browse pages
 Very convenient size and weight - easy to handle and fit in pocket
One note: As mentioned by another reviewer, you must setup messaging with AT&T's message center number in order to send SMS(unbranded phone)
To say I'm satisfied would be a little understated
 Good job Nokia




The phone's functionalities are at par with what most reviewers and review sites have stated

unfortunately everything that it came with before as standard accessories were missing or in more appropriate words reduced (hence the price cut perhaps
)

Nokia took their time replying to my query as to what the sales package originally come with
 Don't expect it to come with the same contents as the Euro, Asian counterparts because you'll be disappointed

Do take note that this is not Amazon's fault as Amazon merely resells these products to us

In fact Amazon was kind enough to send me a replacement as soon as I had informed them that the 'stand' (among other things) was missing

 Unfortunately it was still missing in the replacement

 In between the time it took for Nokia to respond to my query and the arrival of the replacement, I decided to keep the replacement and send back the first one, after Nokia finally answered that it was not included but gave no explanation why it wasn't
 One thing to note as well

 Both 5800 versions I bought from Amazon, this Xpressmusic version and the Navigation Edition does not come with the proprietary Nokia microsdhc cards

 they came with microsdhc cards rated class 2, and these came with the Nokia-sealed tape, which means they were factory sealed

 so I dont' know why that is the case

Other than that, the phone serves its purpose and is a keeper
I thought it was a reasonable price for a Nokia touch screen phone with WiFi, 3G, GPS, etc
 and costs lot less than Iphone too, so I ordered it
 But it starts having a problem less than two weeks since I use it
 It froze on me everytime when I go online, go to menu, go to apps(I have downloaded some apps), and before I decided to return it, both the dialer pad and contact list pad don't work at all no matters how many times I press it
 It SUCKS the big time


I strongly do not recommend this phone at all

 If you want a touch screen phone, get an Iphone or Droid

The XpressMusic phone by Nokia is a great phone but after 2 months of using, problmes arise
 Firstly the phones functions begings to slow down and this is without using the memory card at full capacity
 To change applications takes about 30seconds or more and in some instances, it freezes
It has come to the point now where I have to remove my phone battery when it freezes
I would not recommend anyone to get this phone

I ordered this phone through Amazon, arrived very quickly and the box had the original Nokia seal which is nice as all phones in the stores here come already opened so you dont know where they have been
The phone comes almost bare bones (the manual is very skimpy also)
 After you download new themes and applications this is when the phone starts to shine through
 The positives:1
 Nice screen in indoor light2
 Boots fast and applications open fast3
 Nice sound4
 Solid java and flash support already installed
5
 I downloaded new themes and backgrounds (go to [


] for lots of free stuff)
 Installed gmail push email through [


] which was extremely easy, now I get notification when I get new emails and I dont need to go through the web
 I installed eBuddy for instant messaging, which is 100% free and awesome
 The interface is very windows like, its like chatting on your computer
 Downloaded SPB Weather for HTC like weather info
 Nice looking
 Youtube, Facebook and all that stuff runs great
 I downloaded PC Suite from Nokias site in order to be able to synchronize my Outlook calendar
 For MS Office and Adobe Acrobat document viewing and editing I got QuickOffice (which has a $19 offer) and Adobe reader
6
 I love all the keyboard alternatives
 Handwriting recognition works very well
7
 Ovi store has a basic interface but actually has a lot of free or for pay stuff
Now the negatives and why no 5 stars:1
 Battery doesnt last long if you use wifi or surf a lot
 Lasts around 8 hrs with heavy use and 1-1/2 days with light use
2
 Screen could be better in sunlight3
 Too many double or triple clicks to do stuff
4
 Crappy camera
 Come'on Nokia you are supposed to be the phone camera kings
 In good sunlight the pictures actually come out pretty nice, otherwise they are awful but you can tweak them on Photoshop or other program
5
 I haven't been able to work the GPS, always says satellite signal is low, even on open air fields
 However, I dont care about GPS but other people do
6
 Manual that comes with the phone is awful
 Had to go to the web to search for a lot of "how to" stuff
7
 They should include PC Suite or enable Outlook syncrhonization with the included Ovi Suite
Hope this review helps someone

Al momento de comprarlo, no me fije que era la version america, sin embargo no he tenido problema usandolo en venezuela con la operadora digitel, la conexion de datos es rapida, el wifi y gps excelente, la camara un poco decepcionante al principio, ya que tomaba fotos blanquecinas, pero esto cambio totalmente cuando se actualizo el firmware del equipo, mejorando mucho la camara
otro punto debil del movil es la duracion de la bateria cuando utilizas el wifi, se consume rapidamente, del resto dura entre 1 y 2 dias
es rapido y la intefaz es muy intuitiva, el touch es muy bueno, la pantalla insuperable


lo recomiendo ampliamente, solo lo cambiaria por un nokia n900 ja ja ja




I bought this cell phone, and the box said it came with a 8Gb memory card, but it didn't came
I have write to amazon two times, no answers yet

well


i just got this sweet phone from amazon a couple of weeks ago, and is a very good phone, it has nice features, the image is good, camera is good, touch screen is not as sensitive as the iphone, but is very good also


anyway is a good phone, i rather nokia than iphone anyway, nokia is tougher
the only problem that i had with is that the speakers is not that good



when you put a music with some boom boom like hip-hop and the volume is at his maximum it get a lil distortion, its noticible when you put the speakers at max volume
but thats the only problem


witch is not even a problem, if you want to listen to loud music buy a boom-box
by the way



the volume with the headphones on is loud and good
so if you where like me, allways with a mobile and an ipod, just buy the nokia 5800 express music
you gonna like it
 thanks for reading, i hope it helps

It's my first 3g phone and I really like it, ease to use, good screen quality but the camera is not good

I think the phone overall is very nice



I bought it back in May of this year ('09)
 Now


only a little over 7 months of having the phone, my screen is constantly going out


the phone will be on and flly functional, but the screen will not light up



i've changed the battery, the charger, resetting

still no luck
 I called Amazon to see how I would go about getting it replaced,

and they couldn't help me because it was after 30 days of the purchase


so where does my full year warranty come in
 well i contacted Nokia as well


the customer service was not good


and they basically told me they wouldnt replace my phone


i'd have to send it in and wait until they fix it (supposedly) and send it back
 I really loved my phone, but this dissapoints me
 I prob wont buy another Nokia touchscreen

excellent product 

 I arrive in good condition and works perfectly 


 and came with all accessories 

 I recommend
This is a very good phone from nokia
 I am not used to touchscreens but getting more and more used to it now
 The symbian OS is very stable and mature
Pros:The phone is STURDY (I disagree with all the comments which says the phone isnt well built
 The phone is VERY well built
 You can see some test results here: [


] )The GPS: The nokia web site is wrong, it has a dedicated GPS chipset and not just A-GPS
 A-GPS is supported if its available- but its not required
 With A-GPS on, the phone locks in to the satellites in about 5 seconds
 My Garmin NuVi takes about 3 minutes
The processor speed: The applications seem to be really fast
Touchscreen: It has handwriting recognition, stylus and plectrum stylus and you can also use your fingers
Firmware: This issue was unclear to me before I bought the phone
 Nokia now gives out v40 firmware for US customers as well
 This firmware gives you kinetic scrolling (iphone like scrolling) and a lot of other fixes
Cons:Nokia is VERY INCOMPETENT with firmwares of USA variant phones
 You will receive firmware upgrades about 3 months after the rest of the world
However, you have very little control over this
 All 3 North America variant unlocked 5800s get the same treatment
The PRODUCT CODE for this variant is 0577454
 As of now, the rest of the world is in v50 firmware but we are still in v40
 Please google that product code and firmware to know more about this situation
Camera is grainy in the darkYou need to buy the PDF reader and QuickOffice
The dialpad has no alphabets

 (you will have a hard time with 1-800-CAL-WHAT)iPhone killer: (differences with the iphone)Better CameraBetter Music playersturdierBetter upgrading optionsLower costBetter browserMature OS (with Flash)Support for A2DP bluettoth (clear sound in bluetooth headphones)Better screen ResolutionMore touchscreen inputs (like stylus and handwriting)2 cameras and support for video calls

Excelente telefono
 El software es bastante rapido y su sistema de sonido es de muy buena calidad
 No tiene comparacion
 La memoria de 8GB te da capacidad de almacenar una gran cantidad de canciones y la calidad de las fotografias de indudable
 La camara secundaria te permite hacer llamadas en videoconferencias y ademas tomar fotografias y grabar videos de ti mismo
 Las aplicaciones preinstaladas y las que puedes instalar hacen al Nokia 5800 una herramienta bastante util
 Desde todo punto de vista este smartphone sirve tanto a jovenes como a ejecutivos
Lo negativo del aparato es que en algunas oportunidades el sistema se hace inestable y se hace necesario reinstalarlo
 Esto dependiendo del uso que se le de

The 5800 was on time, I didn't have any problems with the traslation of the product

The phone:The phone is ok
 If my husband did not have iPhone, I would have said 5800 is very good
 However, when comparing to the iPhone, its not as responsive and not so pleasant to deal with
 It is not a great issue for me, because I rarely use internet on the phone
 If I was, it would have been frustrating
Nokia:If there is a promotions coming with the phone, don't count on them
 I had a $50 rebate which I could not get after more than 5 months talking with them almost every 2 weeks
 Even though I filed in all the necessary doc's and filed everything in time, I was not able to get what was promised to me
 Every single time they had a lame excuse like the wrong IMEI (had to send them the photo of the phone, even that didn't help)
 Very frustrating and a really bad service
The bottom line, the company is a phony
 I thought Nokia was big and respectable, but turned out they aren't
 Would never buy anything from them again
 Would not recommend it to anybody either
 Wonder if that's the company's policy to loose clients over a $50 rebate



This is my best cellphone ever
 All the functions and applications are great, these are my favorites:- Wi-fi internet connection
- Qwerty/Tactil keyboard
- GPS and maps
- A lot of music and images storage capacity
If you want a cellphone but you don't want a Iphone, this is the one

This is the worst phone I've ever come across, even worse than my other cheap $20 Nokia
 I bought this as a gift for my wife and she's only had problems since then (5+ months)
 Here's the how and the why
- The phone frequently shuts down without warning, sometimes in the middle of calls but most often of its own accord
 The only way to "reboot" it is to remove the battery
 Just recently it refused to start even after the battery was removed and we had to plug into the charger to get it working again, even though the battery had been fully charged the previous day
- It misses calls quite frequently (and no, it's not a network problem because all my other phones have no such issues)
 For example, I call my wife several times in a row, I can hear the phone ringing on my end but on hers, the 5800 doesn't ring or give the slightest hint that a call is coming through
- The alarm feature is worthless
 It never goes off in the morning when my wife sets it but occasionally goes off randomly during the day
- The resistive screen is bad
 I realize it's no iPhone but still


 a fair amount of pressure is required to operate it and sometimes you need to perform an action twice because it doesn't register
- Scrolling is pretty bad
 Don't think iPhone but instead try to imagine a very thin scroll bar on the right side of the screen that you have to target in order to scroll
- The "web browser" is pathetic
 I had a hard time figuring out how it works (with wifi)
 It's not really a browser but more like a search box where you enter the web address
 There are no classic back, forward, stop, reload buttons but instead a menu that you have to access for these functions
 Only browse online if it's a matter of life or death, otherwise the "experience" is an exercise in frustration
 I'll give it this much though: connecting to a wireless network was fairly painless
- The radio feature is clunky and counter-intuitive, at least compared to my $20 Nokia
- The back cover is a thin and flimsy bit of plastic
 That wouldn't be such a big issue if my wife didn't have to remove the battery daily in order to reset the phone
- The SIM card holder has to be the most idiotic system I've ever seen
 Inserting it requires the removal of a very flimsy plastic tag
 The SIM mechanism isn't spring loaded so in order to remove it you need to remove the back cover, remove the battery, extract the stylus and then push the SIM out using the tip of the stylus
- The GPS is useless
 I bought this phone largely because of the GPS, happy that I could get a GPS "smartphone" that doesn't require a contract
 I still regret it to this day
 To get the GPS working you have to be in an open field or perhaps in a desert with nary a tree in sight
 Even then, it takes at least 15 minutes (

) for it to locate a satellite
 Once it finds one, it has trouble keeping it locked and it seems to have a hard time updating your position on the screen while moving
 If you have a death wish or perhaps masochistic tendencies, try using this feature while driving
- The virtual keyboard is a pain to use
 Luckily the other functions (like web browsing and navigation) don't work well enough to require a keyboard so we can get by without one
These are the major issues that bother my wife and I
 One redeeming quality is that the map application that comes with the phone is fluid and responsive
 Too bad the GPS doesn't work
 Good thing we know how to read a map without a GPS
In conclusion, I would advise anyone to stay away from this phone
 For what I paid ($270), this is a major ripoff
 Honestly I wouldn't even pay $100 for the 5800
 $50 or less is a more realistic price, provided you are willing to deal with all its shortcomings and software bugs
 Too bad I didn't pay closer attention to the bad reviews before I bought it
 I realize that I could probably get this exchanged or repaired under warranty but that's such a big hassle (not to mention being without a phone for the duration) that I'm not willing to put up with it
At least I can claim that I've learned from past experiences and this is the last Nokia phone I'll ever buy
 Thanks Nokia
 I used to be a big Nokia fan and always had the best opinion for their products but they've lost me as a customer and I'll make sure to inform everyone I can about their poor products

It is a nic phone but sometimes the os can get freez

 and slow, but it has many nice funtions
So far it's an OK phone
 I expected it to be more responsive to touch
 Not even close to I-Touch(very smooth)
 Another problem I ran into: the alarm would ring everyday even though I edited it to ring on certain days
 One thing I really like is Wi-Fi
 Just think about Verizon and AT&T announcing raising prices on data plans for heavy data users
 This phone will save you tons of money
 All applications that require data access can be set to use Wi-Fi
 I'm still looking for applications that would work on this phone, free and fit me, like security(everyone is a trial), sports news(found only AP News Mobile), games that are user friendly
 Overall it's a good phone
 and the best thing about it-it's unlocked

At bottom page of downloading a map with free navigation [


], a charge for transferring any amounts of data over-the-air should be collected by any phone network
 Without a data plan, these providers automatically charge transferring data per kilobyte as a basic included feature
 In addition, any Nokia applications should link directly to the main browser of service network on the phone as a default without any exchange
 As a result, a charge should be counted on the phone bill when starting an up-to-date of a firmware or downloading a new application over-the-air
Final words, using Wi-Fi without any charge is only when I already controlled it with the following steps (while I do not need a data plan):1
 select Connectivity,2
 select Wi-Fi/WLAN (on second line because the default network is on the first line),3
 select and connect an IP name (already knowing its WEP),4
 select Starting Browser within the above IP to surf the web by hitting it after connected
 The data transferring onto the phone at this time is not through the phone Network
(If going out of this path in order to select an internet global icon on menu, this action will turn OFF the already connected Wi-Fi instead of turning ON the default network with an automatic charge)
5
 ALWAYS make sure to select Disconect WI-Fi (on the same path)
 Indeed, on the Network browser is a must
One more thing, a GPS device unit is the best, and it is completely free for any things
 It is also fast, easy, and more technology
 A-GPS, one of applications on the phone causes spending more money because of transferring data over the air and through the phone Network

I resently purchased the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic from TigerDirect through Amazon, BIG MISTAKE
 From day 1 I have had problems with the phone and have had to call Nokia on several occasions
 On the third week of owning the phone it will not power on,if by chance it powers on it freezes on the initial screen and you have to remove the battery in order to power it off
I have called and emailed TigerDirect and they will not take responsibility for the product they sold, I have called Amazon and all they say is "Call TigerDirect"
Needless to say I am completely disappointed with the product and more so with TigerDirect and Amazon for not standing by the products they advertise and sell
John SplainPuerto Rico
I did a lot of research on tech sites and read all the reader comments on Amazon before purchasing this phone
 I was nervous I'd get a dud but to my pleasant surprise this has turned out to be one of the best phones I've had
 A minor thing but very important to me was a loud ringer and loud notifications which this phone has
 People tell me they hear quite clearly when I'm speaking but I hear their voices with that slight muted quality that you can get with a GSM phone but conversations are fine
 This phone allows you to have Google sync for your contacts and calendar only
 It works with the exchange software on the phone and it works flawlessly
 Google sync is in beta and as of right now you can't sync gmail
 The good news is that you Can use Nokia's mail program to set up your mail to be retrieved on your desired schedule
 The radio was decent for a phone I don't use it much
 The screen scrolls well
 There is an update to the phone's software that gives it Kinetic scrolling but it's not yet available to North American users even though this is an unlocked phone
 The UI is not as easy to use as an iphone so prepare to read the manual
 Battery life has been good
 This will vary of course based on how you use your phone
 Mine is mostly email and web browsing with wifi with little phone calling so I'm getting three and half days between charges
 This isn't bad because wifi is hard on batteries
 The camera won't replace anyone's separate camera but is good for the random snapshots
 I haven't tried the video yet
 This phone feels very good in the hand and not at all at slippery
 The app store doesn't have much yet but it is growing
 For the price I think this is a very good smartphone if your lucky enough to get a good one
 Like many cellphone makers Nokia's quality can vary

Within 2 weeks it locked up and had to be sent back to repair
 Texting difficult and can't see both sides of conversation
 There is not many apps, and cannot put windows mobile on it
 Phone calls very good, MP3 player good, would have liked to see the texting and apps to be much more user friendly
 Amazon is a great company to work with have never had a bit of trouble

I've been looking for a new cellphone and have read loads of reviews before making the purchase
 I'm a hardcore open source software user and wanted an unlocked smartphone which would be affordable and highly functional
 This looked like the way to go for me
 I'm absolutely amazed by it, coming from using an older Blackberry
 I'm quite proficient with computers, but have fought and struggled with cellphones, as the operating systems in them just don't "compute," with me
 I'm an older person and perhaps just don't catch on as fast as younger people, but thought I would do better with a phone which was more "computer oriented
" I have to say


the Symbian operating system in the Nokia is great
 I had no trouble setting everything up, the phone makes sense when I use it and I couldn't recommend it highly enough
 This is the greatest cellphone I've ever had
 Wouldn't trade it for an iPhone or anything else, except the Nokia N900 which is out of my budget

Excelent phone for this price I think the best touch screen phone for less than $400 u can found, works perfect in Costa Rican services
So I was a little hesitant to get a nokia touch screen at first because nokia isn't big in the US market as much as it is overseas
 I had a cheap nokia a long time ago and I always found that it had the best reception and best battery life of all my phones
 Let me give you a little info about myself
 I work at a cell phone kiosk in Sam's Club and so I deal with phones with sprint, att, and verizon
 I think of myself as very knowledgable about cell phones
 I have had many
 Here are my pros and cons about this phone:Pros:1) Battery Life: I have had many touch screens (instinct, moment, hero, pixi, G1) and of all the phones I have had the battery life lasts sooooo much longer
 I have been playing with my phone all day running the wifi, making calls, downloading games, playing games, and my battery has not gone down at all
2) Speaker: Sound is so clear and loud
 Probably the loudest I have had
3) Ease of Use4) Size: Not heavy at all and fits perfectly in the hand
5) Screen: Very vibrant and great for watching videos
6) Music: Once again great sound
7) Short cuts on main screen make it really easy to get to contacts you use a lot
8) Ovi market: So many free games that are really well done
 Very different from android where games are really low budget and has ads
Cons:1) Camera: The only thing that I would agree with is the pictures aren't that great


but not bad
 It is sufficient
Bottom line: If you want a great phone for the price this is it

Excelente product, and now with free nokia maps




 much Better

excelent signal, excelent applications and lot of things more

, I recomend this product
This is one of the worst phone in market that nokia has ever made
 Phone dies out of charge even with out talking after 2 hours
 Every 2 hours u need to charge the phone
 This was going for one month since i bought the phone
After one month it just switch off itself
 I recommend to every one not to take this phone
 I wasted a lot of money on this

I am very happy with the phone though I can not even use all its functions
I bought this product and I really having more than I though
 Nice camera, nice sound, good touch screen
 The only issue I found is battery, if you surf internet, use bluetooth and gps all day your battery will die before before the day ends, but not big deal because all smart phones with same characteristics has same issue
 If you live in US you won't have any issues with map navigation, but this is available in only 75 countries
 If you live in a country outside this countries you better install Garmin software

My Nephew is the user of this cell and he is very happy with this cell
 he Does recomed it
 I do recomend the Seller


 Shipment on Time
 No complaints
I had owned various phones in the past and Nokia is the best on any comparison, for the Features available on this phone, had Apple had all these features it will cost 10 times more, most people don't even know it has extra camera on the front for video Calls along with the 3
2 MP on the back, Video is far better and there were no sluggish performance as far as I had used for more than a month, unlike iPhone this phone can run multiple applications at same time which is like multitasking in PC, so I can play music and browse websites at same time and switch to GPS , attend a call and type an SMS

 And it goes on


all at same time, iPhone cannot do more than one at a time, we get millions of free software, games, themes etc
, unlike Apple App store, no need to pay more and more
 Best feature, no MP3 conversion required, if you have lot of MP3 files on hard disk just drag and drop in few seconds, we can play, phone comes with 8GB of SD Card, can upgrade to 16 GB, that's more than enough, I had used the N95 earlier which costs double this price, this is not a NSeries phone from nokia, but it had all the features + touch screen of N series phone at half the price
If you like Garmin for GPS, Garmin GPS software available for this phone and installing that will make it the best GPS (it comes with Nokia's map software too) and no data plan or internet required for GPS as maps are copied to memory
 It comes with lot of add on and Its not too big like iPhone and not too small, exactly made for using with single hand and I had replaced the blackberry phone used for Office with this and configured my Office outlook exchange server along with Gmail, hotmail and yahoo, how cool is that
It handles website just as a PC and there is no difference with any websites, I can login to bank accounts and do anything like PC, it has stereo speakers but the Nokia Headsets are far Superior in sound quality and build and it comes with built in Mic and buttons for music track change so we can play music and attend calls without touching phone
And FM is there to use while driving and at the Gym, Google has lot of software available for this phone like latitude, docs etc
 If you want free chat software Fring ([


]) is available for free, it connects yahoo, hotmail, AOL, Gtalk and Skype users all in one place and we can even make voice calls to online users
 It has the great sync software that syncs all your photos, videos, contacts, notes etc between phone and PC using Bluetooth, just switch on the PC and it does the sync automatically
 We can import and export all contacts from outlook, Lotus notes etc
And there is software to use the screen as a touch screen mouse for the PC like a wireless Bluetooth mouse and that's free too
For brand conscious users like me, I want to buy a phone from a telecom company like Nokia than a computer (apple) or TV (Samsung) company, who were just trying phones as one of their business
iPhone doesn't have many of these features and only selling because of marketing, if nokia did their part, this should beat any phone for sure, I don't want to lock with AT&T for lifetime with iPhone and pay $ monthly and pay for any applications and did I say its unlocked
 What else you can expect from a phone

0 out of 5 stars Nice Smartphone, One of Nokia's Best
, May 14, 2009By Elizabeth M
 Lawinger - See all my reviews(REAL NAME)I am huge on Nokia Phones (tried blackberry 8820, didn't care for)
 I upgraded to this phone from the N95
 I really like the N95, but since I have started texting so much, really got annoying texting on the N95 (it just has a numberpad, no qwerty)
 Landscape qwerty on this phone is really nice, but hand recognition is awesome
 I can write faster then I can type when texting, and if you want to keep notes, memos, lists, etc


 on your phone, the handwriting entry makes it go quickly
 All you have to do is write on the screen and it will type what you write
 A feature to love
I have tried the GPS and it is similiar to the N95
 I tested it against my Garmin Nuvi, and it is very similiar
 Only complaint as that after you pass a road, it takes a second or two longer than the Garmin to realize you did or didn't turn, which is only annoying if you make a wrong turn (I did so on purpose to test), But for a phone GPS, it is great
 Nice for when walking around an unfamiliar metro area
 Didn't use POI's much, but played around enough to know they hit all the major spots in our small town, and when pulling up a cateogry such as restaurants, the list was extensive
 Very, very handy to have GPS on phone, as I never take my Garmin off my car mount, and prefer not to have to
 Also, satellite lock was very quick
 Nice
You can keep 4 contacts (with photo icons) on homescreen for quick calling, texting, etc


 but why only 4
 Wish there was more
 Dialing can be a pain, you have to click several times to get to the point of calling a contact, but I have gotten accusotmed to that (same on N95)
 Nokia should really make it a 2 click process, select contact and call, hope they make that change
 If you pull up the name you want on your contacts you can press the green (go) bar at the bottom of phone and it will call that person
Internet is nice as well, picks up on my wireless internet fast, as well as quickly at the local coffee spot, but haven't used it beyond that
 Video and photos are sweet on the lcd screen
 Bluetooth makes transfer of photos and music from you computer to phone a snap
 The speakers on this phone are amazing for a cell phone
 Very easy to do
 There are lots and lots of other nice applications to play with
This is the best choice I could make for a cell phone (definetly a step up from the N95, which is a subperb phone)
 If you like to text and want a full keyboard (or the ability to handwrite using the stylus), keep documents on your phone, (bluetooth is quick and easy transfer back to computer), want to enjoy videos and music (with great sound), like surfing the web, want a GPS (with no need for a data plan), and are a techy-gadget person like myself who couldn't pass up the idea of having a touchscreen, this is an awesome choice

I had been looking for a new phone for a long time
 Every phone in the AT&T store and at their online site just did not seem to be attractive
 Sure, the iPhone is great, but I didn't want to commit to a 2 year contract with a required $30/month data plan attached
 And I can't replace the battery myself
 Can't use the phone as a wireless modem
 Hmmmm, there must be a better option
 Hey, what's this
 An unlocked Nokia phone that doesn't require a monthly data plan and I'm not locked into a 2 year contract
 I can use the phone as a modem and the battery is easily replaced
 Too good to be true
 Actually it just gets better from there
 Don't want to incur data charges
 Just go find a local wi-fi spot and you're online in a few seconds
 Oh, its an incredible music/media player as well
 The built in speakers are the best I have ever heard coming from mobile phone or any other small device
 If I turn the volume all the way up I can rock my office when I am alone, otherwise I need to turn it down or plug in the headphones
 Did I mention the GPS
 Very nice feature for a phone, but it was a little slow giving directions during a trip to Seattle recently, still worked ok and helped me find my way around town
 I signed up for the free trial and it was useful, but my Garmin does a better job, but the Garmin was more expensive than this phone and that is its primary function
 Still a cool feature, but that's not what I bought it for
 First and foremost I use this as a mobile phone
 You know, talking to people the old fashioned way, by voice
 And this phone does that function flawlessly as well as letting me access the internet either via hot spots or through AT&T's 3
5G network (must mean that they're half way to 4G), which blankets Southern California and worked well in Seattle too
 The other features you'd expect are present as well, a decent 3
2 mg camera and video that are fun to use, 8gb of micro SD storage and easy USB connection to your computer for uploading your favorite tunes, which you can use for your ringtones
 So if you want a great phone that does just about everything an iPhone does and a few things more, for less and without a 2 year contract and a required data plan, check out this Nokia, you won't be disappointed
 In the interest of full disclosure, I have to admit that I signed up for an unlimited data plan for $15/month that does not carry any commitment, I can drop it at any time, but I enjoy being able to look things up or access my email while away from my office that I have continued to use it
 Also, don't be concerned that this is an unlocked phone, its too easy to set up if you have an existing phone you are replacing
 Just slide out the sim chip in the old phone and slide it into the Nokia
 Pop the battery in and you are good to go
 Now go have fun

Well the nokia 5800 is a really nice phone, great price at amazon as always, a bit on the chubby side, but is very easy to use
 Great feautures for the price
Very easy to use, all the right functions
 The first phone I received did't charge, but Amazon replaced extremely fast at no charge with a new phone that works great
Camera is excellent, battery life is awesome
Very satisfied with the phone

Well, all I have to say is that this phone is amazing
 It's light, beautiful and It is a really smartphone
 You can download and install a lot of apps from Ovi Store (like you dowmload apps for an iPhone from the iTune store)
 You can keep your 4 favorite contacts on the main screen
 I had an iPhone and I sold it to buy this awesome Nokia 5800
 I also upgraded my Nokia 5800 to 16GB (something you can't do with an iPhone)
 When I bought it I thought 3G was not going to work in my town 'cause it says that this is the U
S
 version and I live in D
R
 But, 3G works perfectly with Claro which is the only communication company that provides 3G in town
 I totally recommend this phone
 5 stars

This is my 1st touch screen phone
 I've been using it for 6 months now
 It's a decent phone for its price
Pro:- Good music quality
- Easy to use interface
 However, not as fun or fancy as iPhones
- Ringtone is loud enough
- There is a secondary camera
- Video recording quality is good
- Nice big screen (the glare issue could be corrected by buying a stick on anti-glare protection film)- GPS- Wireless connection- FM radio- Easy to transfer data to and from PC- Call quality is good- Expandable memoryCons:- Bad camera for its 3
5MP and Carl Zeiss lens, the image tend to come out pixelated with strong blue hues
- US version only come with 4 languages and supports no Asian languages
 No place to purchase language pack or software update yet
 This is a big turn down for multi-lingual people like me which had a tough time trying to figure out text messages in Chinese while traveling in China
- Home screen customization is rather limited
 The 5530 showed some improvement on this, so I hope the future firmware update could do the same
- It's not a pretty looking phone
I purchased this phone and am quite content because in my country Costa Rica works best
 I like its touch screen, resolution is great, the sound is terrific and I can also watch videos from youtube
 Another thing is that it has good coverage and I can clearly hear all the calls, and is very easy to find any contact likewise have no problem to download music in the library and update
 Truth is an excellent phone and meets all my expectations

This was the first electronic product I purchased from Amazon and I couldn't be more thrilled with it
 Functional, easy to follow manual, and does everything the write-up said it would do
I would recommend this phone to anyone who does not want to spend hundreds of dollars on a phone

I have had a cell phone ever since 2002
 I have had many different types of phones
 Nokia has always been my favorite due to the OS, the style, the service, and overall everything
 I have had many different brands of phones and many other Nokia phones as well and I have to say, after having this phone for a month, I can say without hesitation that this is thee absolute best phone I have ever had
 You don't have to trust me on this
 See for yourself the review at [

This is absolutely amazing phone for the money
 It has all the features one can possibly want in a phone
 Here are some Pros and Cons
 The only reason it did not receive a 5 star review is the lack of commitment from Nokia for the US release of this phone, in terms of firmware updates which are long overdue
 (UPDATE: They have released several firmware fixes for the US version and it is amazing
 PLUS FREE NAVIGATION SOFTWARE, beat that i-can't do anything-Phone)Pros:-Amazing interface and ease of navigation-Has great GPS Function
 Nokia maps is awesome and for good measure you can get Google maps to work even better with this device
-Sound is spectacular on the headphones and not too shabby coming from two built in speakers
-Great array of apps online for use as a work phone or a entertainment phone
-Great colors and touch screen response
-Most importantly great sound and connectivity during calls
-Decent camera not great in the dark
Cons:-Nokia doesn't really care too much about the US market when it comes to this phone
 No 3G on T-Mobile and No firmware updates that have been out in other countries for some time now
-Little buggy and sometimes can freeze and needs a restart
 This is why they need to release a US firmware update really badly
-The dial pad lacks letters that correspond, so if you are calling tech support that has e
g 1-800-WHAT good luck figuring out what WHAT is numerically
-Battery is kind of lacking but what touch screen isn't
-A little thick but not too bad
 Other dimensions are perfect in terms of hand grasp for texting and emailing
-Definitely not a camera phone despite its great Carl Zeiss lens
Overall:If you want to put away your ipod and still be able to listen to music, have a good navigation system, be able to SMS/EMail quickly, read Office documents WORD, EXCEL, PPT, PDF on the run, maybe squeeze in a few games, and have a stable OS interface (for most part) this is really a great phone
 I forgot to mention it actually is a great cell phone in terms of call quality
 I did not want to get the G3 from T-Mobile because I am tired of the commitments and have Google force everything down my throat kind of like Apple has been doing to their customers
 This phone has gazillion free apps that are actually useful
 You will be able to squeeze a lot of use out of this phone on the cheap and enjoy doing it

Fast shipping from amazon, item was received faster than expected
 The Nokia 5800 is lightweight and very easy to use
 Most responsive touch screen that I have used
 I went from a N97 to the 5800
 I think it is a better phone for the money, cheaper phone but better quality and responsivness
 It gets better reception, clearer calls, music function is by far the best of any phone I've used or seen
 The apps are all user friendly, disc included with phone shows shortcuts and use of apps
 Nokia definitely got it right with this phone

I got this Phone 2 weeks ago, I like it because it is very firm in hand, touch screen, and have wifi
Amazon send me this phone in mail for free, it took 5 days, the phone came safely wrapped
The phone has some good sides :1
 The touch screen is very good , as I never used an Iphone, but the sensor is good enough for you to use your finger on it
2
 You can handwrite messages which is very convinient to compose a text message or send an email
3
 Compare to Iphone, you can use Wifi to connect to the internet, without paying monthly data plan, but wifi can only be used in an area where have open wireless internet service
4
 The talk quality is very good, clear, you can hear very well
 and very easy to use hand-free speaker
5
 You can save your favorite 4 phone number on the home screen and creat button with an image icon
I like this feature, because I can put my family members phone number on the home screen
6
Easy to use the USB wire to transfer music or pictures from PC to Phone
I like this very much
the phone I do not feel very happy with is :1
 the battery do not last long, I charge it every 3 days, though I do not use text message or connect to internet, nor do I listen to music via it since I got a good Mp3
 so I cannot imagine how can people listen music with it as a MP3
2
 The camera quality isn't good with a 320Mp camera
 take very poor quality pictures with it
3
 some time it frozen the screen, you have to restart the phone to make it work
 but this happens to a lot phone
over all, I think this phone worth of the price, it still a nice phone since no phone is perfect
 I will still buy it

I really like this cell, I at the beginning I had a couple of issues with it but I did an upgrade to the latest software version and everything started to work great, it is really fast browsing and downloading stuff, I will rate this product with an "EXCELLENT"

My daughter wanted an iPhone but even she agreed it was overpriced
 She picked this one to replace her broken Motorola "Ming
" She loves it
 That's saying a lot for someone as picky about her phones as she is
 I gave it 5 stars because of the cost to quality and feature ratio
 Instead of listing what it has, it would be a much shorter list of what it doesn't have
 Check out the specs if you're interested in a good multi feature phone

This phone died within one week
 I had to return it to Amazon for refund
 Amazon was very professional and speedy about the return and the refund, so 100% satisfaction with Amazon
However, the phone was a waste of time and aggravation
 Very cheaply made
Absolutely no confidence in this Nokia product
Nokia 5800 XpressMusic Unlocked Phone with U

 3G, 3
2 MP Camera, GPS, Wi-Fi, and 8 GB MicroSD Card--U
S
 Version with Warranty (Black)
Nokia product is getting worst
 the ring tones play in music player
 nothing change
 need more improvement
 the product is made from china

I had did my research when I was purchasing
 When I purchased the nokia 5800 I was surprised that the shipping was so fast
 I didn't like the tracking system it wasn't very accurate but it did come on schedule
 That's all that really matters
 THe phone itself is great
 I bought it mostly for the music player, but I love every aspect of the phone
 I'm a big texter and this phone is great for texting
 The camera is great
 I had the e71 before this one and by far I love this one

This product is nicely equipped with more than enough features, but for my sole opinion the price should be a little more lower to beat all other competitive

I've Nokia 5800 XM for over a month and I love the phone
 Well worth every single penny
 Interface is not as good and as intuitive as iphone, but trust me you'll get used to it very soon
 Music sounds very good and the external speakers are very good, could be louder, but hey this is a phone not a boombox
Like:1
 Freedom - Being unlocked there are no restrictions on this phone (No more jailbreaking)2
 Excellent feature set in the price range (sub $250) - Bang for the buck3
 Very customizable4
 True multi tasking - Run multiple applications at the same time just like your PC5
 Sync/Transfer files via Bluetooth (Finally you can use bluetooth as it is designed, not just for headset)6
 Handwriting - I hate little dinky buttons and I can write faster than I can type7
 Turn your phone into wifi hotspot (joikuspot)Dislike:1
 Interface is not very good2
 Installing too many apps can make your phone sluggish3
 Horrible camera4
 No VPN (Well there is Cisco VPN Client for IPSEC, but just doesn't work)5
 Could be thinneriPhone comparision:Well, I had an iphone and didn't like all the restrictions that Apple and AT&T had on that
 You've to jailbreak to use many advanced features and worry each time you upgrade your firmware, if it is going to kill the jailbreak
 Besides that you've to be with AT&T forever, atleast as long as you want to use iphone
 AT&T doesn't let you unlock the phone even after the contract perid, pure insane
 Well, you can get iphone unlocked after jailbreaking
 But there is no guarantee that future upgrades won't kill that
 All in all iphone is far superior hardware (and so it thrice as expensive unlocked) but your Nokia 5800 XM won't let you down

This is a really good phone for all of those people looking for a cheaper option for a good touchscreen smartphone
 I personally use this phone with AT&T network, a Go phone account in fact, so you can imagine that having the Wifi is a great feature for me since I don't have an unlimited data plan
 I use the phone a lot to make long distance calls through skype with the program Nimbuzz and I have to say that it's excellent
 Streaming videos live through Qik is also very cool
 It has a good variety of apps
As for cons, well I find it a bit unstable sometimes and I've had to reset it to factory settings twice cause certain features like the camera and music become unaccessible, and I don't even tinker with it much like some do by installing apps from other sites other than the store or installing custom firmware
 This is my first touchscreen phone so I can't really judge too much the keypad but it has full qwerty and I've found it a bit of a challenge to get used to
 Depending on how precise I am, sometimes I write pretty fast (Only a tad faster than T9 with predictive text) and sometimes I struggle a bit
 I love the music player, and the camera and video recording capabilities are awesome
 Also, the browser is more than decent, pretty speedy and you can also use Opera mobile 10 (not opera mini) which feels like a more full fledged browser than Opera mini and is also quite fast
 Youtube works great, and so does google maps and GPS
 Though I suggest you use Nokia maps, that way you can download the maps of your area and install them and avoid data usage, which is great for me
 Brings and 8gb micro SD and I've considered getting a bigger one since the music and multimedia applications are so good :) Still haven't mastered video conversion so I can't opinion on that, but the videos it brought look awesome
Great phone all in all, despite it's small shortcomings

I have purchased this product in april '09 and so far I am impressed with it
 Being a nokia phone user for years, I am well accustomed to the features and interface even with some technological changes (like touch screen)
 The features you will read here are just some of the highlights I think is usually overlooked but as important when using cell phones
Pros:Data management
 An example is for contacts
 You can easily select and transfer phone numbers to and from the sim card
 This is a must when upgrading to a different phone without bothering to use a computer
 Try that with a blackberry pearl you will see what I mean
Unlocked
 You can use most gsm sim cards from around the globe
 (hint get prepaid sims available in most major cities) And this option is a lot cheaper than having to pay international roaming charges
 Another plus is that you are not tied to a network so you can switch whenever you like
Price
 I think this is one of the cheaper phones which has touch screen capabilities without having a contract (of 2 years usually) and no data plan required
 This was 350 USD when I bought it and has gone down to 300 (as nokia is trying to put out a newer model)Cons:As with other reviews, the plastic battery cover needs to be a lot sturdier
 It bends easily as it is made of softer plastic (maybe to prevent it from cracking or becoming brittle
)Thicker dimensions
 Not as sleek as an iphone as it is NOT an iphone
Apps for it is still limited, but expect it to grow over the years

This has to be the best phone that i have ever had
 For a long time it seemed like Nokia was getting left behind, but they have steped up their game
 I wanted a new phone and i was going to get an iphone but then i saw this and how much the iphone fanboys hate it (LOL)
 Im glad i got the nokia 5800, i got all the good things the iphone has and more
Pros:1
 great battery life
2
 wonderful screen
3
 lots of options
4
 lots of apps u can get for it
5
 flash works with it
6
 text, pic, and video messaging
7
 3
2mp camera
8
 perfect call quality
 (at least on at&t)Cons:1
 the only one i could really find, was that the touch was a little to sensitive at first
 that was soon fixed just by tweaking the settings
Overall this is a must buy for those people that want a smart phone with out changing your plan
 This phone has plenty of room to grow with updates and new apps that u can get from the OVI store and 3rd party

This phone is good, very good even, with a good set of features (Wifi, GPS, good music mgmt, video, etc) and nice touchscreen
 However, don't think that this touchscreen is even close to the iphone's
The main problem, though, is the software used to sync the phone with the computer
 It's absolutely useless
 Just look it up on the internet, you'll see lots of complaints
 It's just silly that Nokia can't get this right
 I realize it's probably Vista's fault, but still I think it's Nokia that should adapt
 The funny thing is that the previous versions of the software used on the E71, for example, works perfectly
I think if you are a big music fan and you have the patience the get to know this phone and set it up, it's very good
 If you are looking for something easy to use and your main thing is the touchscreen maybe you should look for another phone

Good phone with some nice options
 Nice touch screen, FM radio, GPS, Music player, cable to connect to PC to add Apps and games easily
 Camera is OK, but not expecting much in a cell phone
 Hopefully in the future manufacturers will address the camera quality since generally you carry this device everywhere

I recently bought this device to upgrade from the Nokia N81 8gb, and so far I don't regret my decision
What I like about this 5800 Xpressmusic:1
- It has great reception2
- It is light (lighter than N81)3
- The big screen is nice, sensitive and requires zero calibration (not like the Palm TX I used to have some years ago)4
- The sound is even better than the one in the N815
- The Internet experience flows very well, you can even watch videos from youtube right from their website6
- GPS


 mixed feelings tough, nice to have one, hard to master it, weak reception7
- The menus are very easy to get used to, very well organized, and you can still change their order or create folders to your own preference
8
- You have 4 different options for writing, from handwriting, to large full qwerty keyboard in the touch screen9
-The accelerometer works very well on directing the screen for vertical or horizontal display
10
- It comes with a micro SD 8gb (reads up to 16gb cards)11
- The PC Suite works great for sync with PC12
- Good to have a 3
2 megapixel camera (although I would only use it for emergencies, since the quality of small sensors is on the very low side)13
- Nice calendar, helps keep up with duties (although I would like some color code for different activities or meetings, something I liked from the Palm TX -although this is not the strength of this device, it is music, so well forget what I just said


)On the weaker side,1
- You cannot see the phone number of any of your contacts when you have dialed it
 You have to enter in the full contact menu to see the phone number
(Still a defect also found in N81, you have to enter in the contacts to do that)2
- GPS has very low reception, so even a tinted window of the car can block the signal3
- Battery life does not seem to last as much as Nokia claims
4
- I miss the 4 way button from N81 (HTC has one for their touch screen models too) This is especially useful to scroll over long pages such as contact lists, moving among missing calls, or just navigating the internet, where if you touch the screen you can easily activate a link
5
- Plastic feels like the shell of an egg (but I guess that's the only way to get small but technologically complex devices)6
- Does not come with protective plastic for the screen (the N81 came with an excellent one from factory)7
- Terrible image organizer and editing
 In N81, you could make albums, navigate over the photos and edit them in few steps, but now, the 5800 does not offer you the album option, you can make a folder and put the photos in, but if you want to rotate them you can quickly do it but won't save the image like that, you need to go the edit to change it, which involves 4 or 5 steps, and once you save it, it takes the image out of the folder you put it in

8
- I am not into gaming, but the touchscreen games are like for kinder kids, forget about the great engage
So then, why is that I am giving this hot toy 3 1/2 stars
Because it is still dragging some few defects coming from the N81, and considering that I am reviewing a cell phone, beyond the nice extras, after all


The calling experience might not be so fluent


When you call someone, you cannot see their phone number if you need it quickly
 I have to go back over the more than 600 contacts to find the phone number I just called


 those of you who have a Nokia know how this can bother big time


 (based on the same Symbian platform as N81)You can press the green call for starting a conversation or you can touch a button in the screen to do the same, so why to duplicate
 Same for ending a phone call
The missing 4 way button (from N81) would have been great to navigate the nice extras of the phone without "aiming" well with the tip of your finger
 But hey, N97 is coming, for a difference of price too
Overall, I recommend (barely) this cell phone, great reception (although this might depend on your service provider), fantastic sound, fluent Internet experience, excellent extras, outstanding screen and resolution, perfectly calibrated
UPDATE June 17, 2009
Cons


 Regarding webmail



1
- If you are answering a message on the webmail (Yahoo, Hotmail, Gmail, etc) say you wrote a paragraph of 10 lines and you need to add something to the 4th line of the paragraph, you CANNOT place the cursor in between, you have to delete all previous 6 lines to get to the position where you can edit your response
 Now, if you don't mind that it is fine, I tend to review what I write and often add or rewrite an idea
2
- Since you cannot place the cursor wherever you want to to write webmail, if you are answering an email and you want to include the original senders message (what is normal) your message will start at the end and not the beginning (as normal) In order to start at the beginning you would have to delete the sender's original message
Regarding crashing


3
- In several occasions it has crashed, meaning that you hung-up a call and freezes, the solution is take the battery off and put it back
4
- In several occasions when you are browsing the web and touch the middle of the screen it closes the browser and disconnects


 anyone with that problem
 I has happened to me 1 in every 10 times or so
I am starting to think that Nokia could read my review to consider these annoying issues on future updates
 :))
I have had this phone almost a month now and I am still discovering its versatility
 It is well worth the cost and does everything I wanted it to do
 I have AT&T as my provider and receive a strong 3
5g signal
 The phone is light, fits well in the hand and the touch screen is beautifully clear and responds well with the stylus
 The reception/sound quality is crystal clear, also
 The volume range is very good and the stereo speakers work surprisingly well
 The FM radio is a nice addition and I find I use it more than I thought I would
 The MP3 player is good; however, their is one thing to note about the Nokia software you use for transferring the files from your computer
 It offers an option to reduce the file size prior to downloading the music to the phone but it seems to greatly reduce the sound quality of the tracks, so I no longer use it
 The wifi/browser works fine and the zoom option helps to make all print readable
 The camera produces excellent photos but do not rely on the auto mode to give you the best shots
 The manual options have proven to allow for much better quality results so it is best to become familiar with them
 This is true with the video recorder, too
 For example, indoors on auto mode the video recording is very grainy but when using low light option the results are great


In fact, better then I had expected
 The video player was a little disappointing because seems with most of the movie files I have played so far there is some drag periodically which is irritating, especially right after the video has started
 I wonder if a more powerful processor is needed or just a firmware update would solve the problem
 Despite this I still give the phone a 5 star because it excels in every other regard
 And finally, I downloaded the free flashlight software I found on the internet and now this phone can be used as a bright flashlight for times when I need to find something in the dark
 I am waiting for a DivX player software for this version of Symbian (which Samsung offers for their phones using the same Symbian operating system) so I can play this popular movie format
When I received the phone I noticed there were 2 tiny scratches on the screen (one was deep), which I couldn't notice until I was outside with the direct sunlight reflecting off the screen
 So inspect the phone carefully right away for that or for any other defects
 Amazon customer service offered to replace the phone but I didn't want to wait for a new one to arrive
 I just wanted to mention it so you know that if you do find there is a problem Amazon is very good about offering support

I have bought this phone few days ago and I must say that this phone has everything you need
Main advantage over the iPhone
- You pay the price once and no need to worry about contracts
 It's unlock phone





- No data plan required like iPhone
- Replacable battery
This phone is very user friendly and simple to use
 So far I haven't had any trouble using this phone

I bought this item and item was bad and i exchanged it but that was too bad
So i think that stock was bad

I really enjoy this cell phone
I was expecting a lot, but it surprised me

This is an excellent smartphone that my son is completely happy with after 3 weeks of use
 He was able to insert the SIM card from his old phone and everything was recognized, and he also transferred all his music files easily to this device
The touchscreen is fantastic, and there are many useful apps available for download
 Good sound, a GPS, web access - it's all there
 Even the phone call sound quality is clear
 (imagine that
)Still, it's overpriced, - but worth buying if you want a great product and good quality

I bought this nokia phone for my son as a birthday gift last September for $299 through Amazon
 He only started using the phone on Oct 16, 2009 and within 2 mths (mid December)it suddenly stopped working
 The phone was left to charge overnight and by the next morning, there was no display
The phone was advertised as carrying a limited warranty and so I emailed Amazon's customer Service to get some recourse
 The Amazon assistance was as follows:"I'm sorry to hear your Nokia 5800 XpressMusic Unlocked Phone with U
S
 3G, 3
2 MP Camera, GPS, Wi-Fi, and 8 GB MicroSD Card--U
S
 Version with Warranty (Black) didn't work out
 Because more than 30 days have passed since you received this item, we can no longer accept a return
""I'd recommend consulting your owner's manual and/or contacting the manufacturer to see if the problem in question is covered by the manufacturer's warranty
"Amazon further advised that I could seek assistance by emailing [


], which I did on January 5, 2010
 Two months later, I am stll awaiting a response
Bottom Line : This is a faulty product with a useless warranty - a waste of $299



I have owned this phone for a few months now and it generally works OK
 I like the touch screen system and the screen resolution is good
 the screen size is nice and large so you can clearly see whats happening
 It comes with a memory card with sufficient capacity (7
6GB) for my needs
 I have also used the WiFi capability to surf internet via wireless networks and it works fine
Unfortunately there are a few things I do not like:1) The phones battery life is poor and unpredictable


-even after you shut off Bluetooth and wireless scanning
2) Nokia ovi stopped working all of a sudden
3) The phone's volume is very low (Xpressmusic

)
 I could use my previous phone as an alarm but not this one
4) Forget about trying to take photos in less than perfect lighting- they will look grainy
5) The GPS works -but it takes rather long to get a position and the altitude accuracy is always terrible
6) if you access the touch screen dialer from main menu- you only get a numeric keypad not an alphanumeric (normal) one

Compared to iPhone, this phone is really difficult to use
 Web browser doesn't support Asian languages
 There is no firmware update to fix this problem

works practically anywhere in the world
works great for any operator in my country (Colombia)
Sometimes when you receive a call, the phone enters lock state 
turn off the phone, and the phone works again
The design of this phone is sober and elegant, providing some services such as wi-fi, radio, camera, web browser, audio recorder and calls recorder are wonderful
the sound quality that has this phone is amazing
the touch screen is not as fast as an iPhone, but everything is compensated for all services that does not carry the iPhone, I'm really happy with my purchase and the truth I do not change my Nokia 5800 with iPhone neverThe flash of the camera is really strong,The design is ergonomic and fits comfortably in your hand
talk about the storage capacity the nokia 5800 is actually far superior than the iphone, because the power to insert memory the 8 gb or 16gb gives you the advantage of bringing a lot of information in your hand 





 Nokia is Nokia
two weeks ago i had this phone
 everything works perfectly except for the batterie, it dies so quick
 I really don't know about the gps and donwload videos yet
 there was the phone case and tv out cable missing in the box
 So many free games and applications to download from ovi store and too many applications slow the phone
 I hope this review help






Nokia 5800 XpressMusic Unlocked Phone with U
S
 3G, GPS with Free Voice Navigation, Wi-Fi, and 8 GB MicroSD Card--U
S
 Version with Warranty (Black)This is a very good cell phone, it has all the great features one might be looking for, the screen is really large with high resolution
 The built-in stereo speakers deliver crystal clear sound
 The only thing I kinda dislike about it is the camera, because even though it has a 3
2MP camera with its flash and everything, pictures in dark places come out with bad quality most of the times
 But besides that, I love the phone

all the equipment that you need in a single packagesometimes turns slowly when exiting applications but still rocks
This is a superb phone if you have AT&T, it does not support T-Mobile's 3G Network (only EDGE which is today surprisingly good) if it did I would give it 5 stars
 Easy interface, intuitive, navigation works, many applications from Nokia's Ovi Store, e-mail is a bit complicated but works, you need to figure out on your own though how to update its firmware, it has many improvements over the original release from Nokia
 The camera is good (not great) and I love the music library interface, comes with a free 8 GB Micro SD card

I am about to travel to Europe
 So, I did research for couple days on internet
 What I need is a smart phone with a real GPS, instead of A-GPS that requires a data plan (most of US data plans become horribly expensive in Europe)
I selected this phone with real GPS, free map, free navigation, touch screen, sliding fingers on screen, 3
2 pixel camera/video, zoom, flashlight, red eye reduction, and etc like an iPhone without data plan
 It also has voice commands





When I got this phone, it is really excellent
 GPS works and Map also works great
 But, when I tried navigation, it fails
 No matter how many times I followed instructions on Nokia (and Ovi Map) web site to reinstall Ovi Map, navigation simply won't work
 I spent couple hours digging through users' postings on Nokia's support web site
 Finally figure out that the old map application #3
01# on the phone must be first uninstalled
 Otherwise, the newly installed Map 3
03 #246# won't work, despite it always reports the installation succeeds
 See "Re: unable to install ovi maps 3
03 on 5800XM" posted by Gilles on [


]I almost return this phone becuase it fails deliver the navigation function
 If you read users' posts on Nokia's support site, you will reallize that tons of poeple have the same problem
 I think Nokia better updates its web site ASAP
 Otherwise, many people will unknowingly return this great phone
Once the navigation also works (without data plan and go online), I really think this phone is EXCELLENT, especially compare its prices/functions with iPhone
 Of course, I agree iPhone may give a more fancy illusion and is falsely perceived as a more fashion toy

I just purchases a Nokia 5800 from Amazon
 One of the first things I tried was to connect to my wireless network
 I have never had a problem connecting to my wireless network with laptops, printer, and my son's iTouch
 Every time I try to connect to the network the phone says I'm connected but when I try to browse a website I receive the message "No Gateway Reply"
 After spending several hours trying to figure out the issue I contacted the Nokia helpdesk and they said the phone has issues connecting to Wifi
 They sent me a shipping label to have the 5800 sent to their repair facility in Alabama
 I packaged up the phone and sent it in for repair
A week later the 5800 came back with a note that they did a "Software Upgrade and Phone Reset"
 I turned on the phone and connected to my wireless network and then as soon as I tried to open a web page I received the "No gateway reply" message again
 I called the Nokia helpdesk again and they said they didn't have any record of my phone, Grrr
 I gave them the serial number and finally they figured out that the phone had been sent in for repair
 I asked the Nokia support person what they were going to do and she said she would escalate to some other group and that they would get back to me in the next 48 working hours - whatever that means
I am very disappointed with this phone and company

I guess like most thing, this phone started out being a rock star
 I loved the way it looked
 I loved the sound and quality of the music and the ease of use between my PC and the phone itself
 It came loaded with easy to use software
 Not to mention, its kind of cool having a phone that is light years ahead of anything they even have in the AT&T store
 I have always been a PDA kind of guy until this phone
 This time, I wanted a little more fun phone
 Something that was more music but, could handle my on the road demands of email and internet surfing
 This phone did all of that


UNTIL
 About eight months of having, I started to notice little thing
 Like, it kept powering off with the lightest touch
 This got so bad, I had to put a little piece of paper between the battery and the case to press it into place
 Then, for about a month, I could not SEND text
 I could get them, I could send email, I could send pic's, I could not send text
 I am not hating on Nokia at all, I am just a little concerned
 Would I not recommend Nokia, NO
 They make great stuff
 I just want people to know little things I have run across since I have had mine
 I am very close to picking up the N97 now so, I am not done with them


although I will make sure the service contract is IRON CLAD this time

bought this phone as gift for my wife
 she loves it, loves the features
 great product for a great price

I bought this cell phone because it looked amazing online and was packed with some great features like the touch screen, 3G support, wifi, 3
2 MP camera with flash, etc
 However, my excitement about buying Nokia 5800 cell phone did not last for long
 When I switched on the phone I felt that the screen was too cluttered with icons, the touch screen was not too responsive and the interface was not user friendly
 In spite of having a Carl Zeiss camera lens with LED flash, the pictures taken were not that good

I bought this phone mainly because I couldn't afford the high cost of AT&T's iPhone monthly packages
 I'm also not one of those people who need their phone for business, so I passed on a blackberry
 However, I find it extremely useful to be able to go online without needing to be near a computer
 e
g when I'm lost in NYC and even the locals can't direct me (Google Maps is great right
)
 I can also connect to my wireless network with ease when I'm at home and chilling on the sofa and can't be bothered to get my laptop
 I like the fact that I can store music on this phone, take pics and videos (although not the best quality, especially at night) and listen to the radio
 Its an extremely good phone in my opinion and I'm glad I made the purchase
 Also, because I can get unlimited Web deal from my phone company for $10, my bills are much more affordable than they would be if I had the iPhone from AT&T
However



its a little bulky compared to the iPhone and most blackberries
 For me that's cool because it slips out of my pocket less than my other phone and I drop it less too (I'm one of those annoyingly clumsy people
)
 What annoys me the most though is the fact that there is no alphanumeric keypad option when you want to make calls
 Its only available for text messages and web browsing
 Fine if you're in Europe where phone numbers are always given numerically, but in the US, phone 'words' are used all the time, so you either have to memorize the alphanumeric keypad or switch to text messaging to type out memorize the number form of the word
Despite those minor flaws (in my opinion), a very good phone indeed

Let me start by saying this is my second 5800 XpressMusic
 I purchased it because I need to send my first 5800 (purchased direct from Nokia) in for service (one too many drops)
 I did not think I could go a couple of weeks without my phone so I bought another
 I keep a Nokia N75 for backup but it was driving me crazy thinking I would have to use it for weeks; I use my phone way too much and have become quite addicted to the touch screen
 I was having trouble making a purchase on the Nokia website so I decided to try Amazon
 So far, I cannot complain, it was brand new, straight out of the box
 Shipped on time and got it the day quoted on the site
 Both of my phones work perfectly, though I have heard horror stories about the 5800 I cannot add to or corroborate them
 I have only ever owned Nokia for myself but I have purchased other brands for family members and have heard more negative things about them than I have about Nokia
 This phone does everything I want it to do and more
 The only thing lacking in the phone I purchased here was no music stand, no $50 gift card from Amazon and no car charger
 The original phone came with all three because they were promotional items for the first release of the phone
 I would have loved the gift card but I can live without it, I still have the music stand from the first phone and do not really use it, and as for the car charger, I only need one
 It is a great phone; then again, I am a huge fan of the Nokia brand
 Nokia customer service is lacking but they usually hit the nail on the head with their phones
 The 5800 is not too big and it is not too little, easy to navigate through shortcuts and menus
 The camera is great and takes good pictures, the screen is gorgeous and looks nice when surfing the web
 I have a 16 GB memory card so I have more than enough memory for whatever I want to store on it
 My battery life is ok; I listen to music all day on stereo bluetooth, so I really give it a work out and have to keep it charged
 The Nokia Ovi store has great apps and games to personalize your phone with, if you have not checked it out, you should

I was looking for a smart phone without a contract that doesnt cost an arm or a leg
 This phone fits the bill perfectly
 It has great features like WiFi, a full QWERTY key-board, excellent multi-media capabilities
 The touch screen is not as sensitive as an iPod / iPhone when you use fingers, however with the provided stylus it is comparable
 The built in browser is good and fast
 There are some quirks though, esp with MS outlook synchronization and calendar usage, but this is not a great drawback from my perspective

I don't think you can realistically get a more capable phone for the money than the Nokia 5800
 Functionally, it's not much different than the N97 mini
 Now, of course the materials and fit and finish are different, but the underlying software is VERY similar
 Other than the home screen widgets, it's running essentially the same version of S60 5th Edition
If you're looking for an economical unlocked phone with lots of features, I highly recommend the 5800
--Matt
I bought it just 16 days ago, and I can briefly tell you that it was a very good deal, all my respect for Nokia, Amazon and UPS all of them had an excellent service, and the phone works fine, the GPS takes a while (aprox
 5min) to connect for free but besides that everything works great
I'm using it with a mobile company in Mexico and as soon as I turned it on, it got the signal, the screen is a neat widescreen (but very fragile, so be ready to buy a screen protector),I totally recommend you the phone and Amazon deals

This is a good phone, but the interface is a bit rough
 When i say rough it really means that it is quite difficult to find some thing on the phone
 I would also like to highlight that wireless connection breaks very often, and you are not notified if this happens

The Nokia 5800 is a good phone but has its downsides:Pros:- Touch screen is responsive- The full keyboard is spacious- Has a stylus but isn't really needed- Feels sturdy- Comes with 8GB of storage- Decent camera for a cell phone,- Internet browsing is decent- Comes with Wifi and Bluetooth- Good music player/radioCons:- The memory card is very hard to remove
 BE CAREFUL
 When I tried removing it to transfer data via SD slot, the card was such a tight fit the chip was damaged
 I had to buy another memory card
 It hasn't happened again but just the fact this is possible is a fatal flaw in its design
- The accelerometer is too sensitive
Overall:It's a good phone and affordable, however, not good for anything other than calling or listening to music
 If you want an internet device, go with the higher end smart phones (iPhone, Blackberry, Droid, etc)
This phone has almost all you require from a new cell; It has some problems when is working at temperatures over 35ºC it can become hanging
 Also become heat when you use Wi-Fi for long period of time
 If you avoid abuse of shocks and taking care its limitations, it is a good deal

For the price that i pay


 the phone results very usefull


was a good choise for me
Many times the screen will freeze and the only way to get the phone working agin is to remove the battery




what a piece of cr




After two months of little use, this products decides to shut down when ever it wants to
 I mainly use it for the music player purpose and that is when it wants to shut off repeatedly
 I have tried all the recommendations in the manual to reset it but it has actually gotten worse
 It "was" a nice phone with GPS and music player features but it seems only Apple and Motorola can make phones that last over three months



This is my second one the same kind of cellphone
 I was happy with the first one but it was destroyed, so I decided to get the same kind again
 But unfortunately this one is not the same
 I'm not happy now at all
 I have problem to make a call to a numbers where is the computer asistance that inquires you to enter some number or pasword (for example for voice-mail)
 I can press no number because the keyboard is always getting black and I HARDLY can keep it lighting up at least for the little moment I could press the number
 It is just fleshing again and again
 And if I am accidently successful and I can press the number I was required to - nothing happen
 It is not working
 I'm required to do that again and again and again
 I'm really loosing my temper with that
 I am gonna to send it back
 I don't want a cellphone like this one is

Very good cell phone for the price
PROS: Touch function, Screen resolution, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Variety of applications available (including Skype), GPS for free, earbuds, phone speaker, signal strength
CONS: GPS aplications resident are confusing, Media manager is not friendly, battery life is terrible

One of my best cellphone that I hadCamera okTouchscreen very intuitiveSoftware fineand Hardware perfect
I luv my nokia 5800 phone , it's lite and compact and lots of apps and downloadable software to use 
 Luv it

This phone is good when you have a wifi hotspot at your home and work place
 You can use voip service(e
g vopium) to make calls
 With Vopium you can make calls to any US number for 1 cent
 I am using t-mobile prepaid service and Vopium and I get around $10 phone bill every month(compared with $50)
 When I make calls using Vopium, my t-mobile mins are not used
 The phones music player is good and camera is not bad
 The display is ok but if you compare with iphone4 retina display, this phone stays at bottom
 There are many apps in nokia ovi store for free but the paid ones are good
 I didn't use navigation system
This phone costs same as iphone4 or any android phone(with contract), but with iphone4 you have to pay atleast $60 every month and there will be some hidden costs as well
 Hope my review is helpful to you and good luck with your phone search

I am very pleased with the purchase, is an excellent article which I have acquired

Functionality is very excellent and useful (multiple alarms, wife, touch-screen) but I have twice experienced that after charging overnight, the next day the unit will get very, very warm and will just die
 Returned it for safety reason

I had upgraded the micro SD card from a 8 gig to a 16 gig
 Afterwhich, I uploaded 8+ gig apps, music and video
 Upon restarting the phone, the OS would not boot past the Nokia blue welcome screen
 The phone would then just freeze at the screen
 I had to perform a hard reset and remove the memory card in order to have the phone boot up properly
 Then, I removed some apps, music and video below 8 gigs for the phone to boot properly
 I returned the phone because it didn't live up to what it was advertised



being able to handle 16 gigs
 I, then, borrowed my friend's Euro-spec version of the phone and it seemed to work without any problems

Too much to be truth
1
 I put Garmin software and works just like a Garmin GPS
I can also use Google maps in which you can walk or drive your car and see your position on the satellite image
2
 3G signal is always 100% even in rural Costa Rica where I live
3
 I put Joikuspot and it works as a 1
5 Mbps router, anywhere I go
Right now I am using it to write this on my Ubuntu laptop
4
 Sync with Google Calendar and contacts fast and excellent
-why should anyone need Exchange Server anymore



5
 Excellent camera, video recorder, I even scan documents with it even if I have a scanner around
6
 Offline multilanguage dictionary7
 Excellent video, music and audio book player8
 Bright flashlightI miss is a portable bluetooth keyboard, PDF and office reader, but all are available
Well I would love the IPhone's beautiful and smooth interfase (which is far better than any other) plus snooze options for remindersToo much and too good to be truth
 No
The Nokia5800 XPress is really an outdated smartphone for a high price
 Turn on WiFi is cumberson and always 3 step process through the menu
 Aside the telephone functionality it has no intuitive user interface
 Save the money and get a smartphone of a newer generation or keep the old cell phone and get an iPod touch

Excellent device for a good price
 You can have all the right solutions in your hand, such as internet navigation, email and multimedia
 Easy to use, easy to install new and cool applications like GPS maps and games
 Better than Iphone, and trust me, I'm a true Mac user
Cool design, small and light weight
 The 8Gb microSD card it's perfect to store data, music and videos, but if you need more space you can upgrade it with a 16GB card

This phone is too complicated to use
 I had this phone for almost a month now and I still couldn't figure out how to use some of the features without using the manual book
 The battery only last a couple days after fully charged
 The headphone wire is way too short
 The lengh is from your ear to your upper chest
 Therefore, unless your coat has a pocket on your upper chest, you have to hold your phone in front of your chest everytime you try to enjoy the music quietly
I will not recommend this phone to a friend

Power off your NokiaBefore removing your tiny memory card, take note of the orientation as you are removing it, if you forget RTFM (Read The Find Manual)Power on your NokiaA screen will show up asking if you want to get out of the offline modeSelect "YES", thank God
If you select "NO", you Idiot
, repeat this instruction from the beginning
Good Luck mate





































Source (Thanks to Nigel):I have a nokia N80 smartphone with the latest firmware (v5)
 I also have lots of customized applications installed
Yesterday I switched it to offline mode, and then powered down
MISTAKE
On powering up I then got prompted for "Do you wish to stay in offline mode" but regardless of what I entered it would not go online, and was running slow
 A very smart phone now


 :-(I tried all combinations of power up/down, menus etc to no avail, although did notice on shutdown I could see the "Enter PIN" dialogue, but it was hidden/in the background and inaccessible
Finally I removed the memory card and it switched to online mode perfectly
 I was then able to replace the memory card & things carried on working fine
So I guess some sw interaction - but a useful tip - if you get stuck in offline mode, try booting up without memory card
 I also recommend installing all except critical software to the memory card - makes it easy to disable in case of any problems-- Nigel





































no gateway replyUse the instruction as a guide
 If you follow the instruction verbatim, you might end up confusing your self like I did
 Best of luck

De entrada es magestuosa su presentación
 Totalemtne tactil, amigable y poderoso
 Existe la posibilidad de agregarle mas capacidad de memoria a través de la ranura de expansion, yo ya encargue una de 16gb, ya que de paquete trae una de 8gb
 95% recomendable, el resto 5% no lo recomendaría por ser algo complicado con el sistema de posicionamiento de GPS, a una semana de haber activado la cuenta de un mes gratis, no me he podido conectar con ningun satelite, no de modo general ni de modo asistido
 Y justamente esta herramienta del GPS fue lo que me llamo la atencion al momento de hacer la compra por lo cual me siento un poco frustado
 Espero conseguir la solucion al problema lo más pronto posible
 En lo multimedia perfecto, en sonido externo fenomenal, es altamente recomendado, los videos corren de maravilla
 Graba video, y toma fotos como un profesional
 En resumen, si se solventa lo del GPS y el satelite, sería el mejor telefono del momento

I Got this Phone yesterday and i`m returning it
The phone is just OK
 and the sound Quality is the worst ever
It does not worth the high price
I Cant Recommend this Phone
And I`ve had bad times with Nokia Phones
UPDATE:Before you buy this phone, Google, Create New Server Profile Nokia 5800
 This is a Common Problem, And Nokia Has no Answer For this

I both this cellphone hear in Amazon, and when i looking for a PIN CODE in a box of product to active the promotion NOKIA COMES WHITH MUSIC for download 8000 musics on computer free, i can't
 This code never come in a box, only cellphone, manual, charger and jack's phone (include ipod jack - surprise for me)
 I liked so much this cellphone, include beautiful disign, longer battery, widescreen quality and the functionally
 Only negative point is the side's of video and photo, because i can't turn to right side to see a video, for exemple, it has only left side default
 Somebody know how can I get this PIN code, or if is possible call to NOKIA USA to see that whith a serial number can active NOKIA COMES WHITH MUSIC
 What is phone number
Waiting your opnion Friends,Maia, Vinicius
This should be a 3
5 star review
 I have used this phone for almost a year now and so far it has been ok
 The phone is a touch phone that comes with a little stylus, which is lost easily but very cheap and easy to replace if you buy spares on eBay
 I barely use the stylus because I find it annoying, but when you want to press a smaller detail on the phone it's good to have
 The display sort of looks like a wanna be iphone, and it responds fairly well to commands
 The camera is nice and the video records fairly clear which is also nice
I have had to send mine in for service twice since I bought it, the first time for them to tighten the seams around when the phone locks and unlocks (it is a little switch that you push up to lock or unlock, which I find annoying and looks like it might break if you accidently push it too hard) which were coming loose, and the second time because my screen went black
 While this was annoying, the good thing was that it happened within the warranty period so the fixed it for free both times
 If you think somethign (and I mean anything)is wrong with the phone, call Nokia right away and don't linger until your warranty expires or else the won't fix it for free
The Bad-The phone is a fingerprint magnet and you will be constantly wiping-The screen is sort of plasticity feeling and not as nice as other touch screens-The phone is too thick, and if you get a cover(which you do need) it gets even thicker-The stylus is annoying and is easily lost-The graphics mess-up and freeze all the time, sometimes distort and you have to lock and unlock, or even reset in extreme cases, to fix them-Every couple of months the phone will get stuck and vibrate uncontrollably, you'll need to reset it to fix-It can sometimes get confused with orientation and won't known whether to be vertical or horizontal when you text-The setting take a little while to figure outThe Good-The phone is the nicest touch phone you'll find at such a low price-The customer service is helpful-It is very resilient for a touch phone and has withstood many falls and bangs (in part thanks to the case)-It seems like it will last you a couple years-It's a nice phone for someone on a budget who wants to get something a little nicer than a basic phone-You can browse the internet-You can download some apps and different features-I have never seen anyone else with the same phone at least here in Florida, and it seems to be a little more uncommon in the US, so you'll probably be the only person you know that owns one (which can be a good or a bad thing I guess)In conclusionIf you want a nice not too expensive touch phone, with some web capability get this phone, but if you're looking for and iphone or Android substitute look elsewhere
 If you want a nice phone that will last you at least a year or two try this one out

I highly recommend not to buy this product
 Tough screen very irritating, have to struggle to find a contact, poor signals, freezes frequently
 Have to through it

Good for 6 months
 Screen took a dump
 Spent almost $30 to send it back and to get it repaired since it's still under warranty
 Phone came back with a new damaged screen and I've been jumping through hoops for almost two weeks now trying to get it repaired
 Will NEVER buy Nokia again even though they've held up before
 Would of given them a zreo had the site let me

The screen started cracking after less than 3 weeks of usage
 Sometimes the ringtone does not come on wehn called

it acts as if it's frozen
 Have already sent a note to the seller for return and still waiting for respond
 Will like to get a refund

I've owned the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic since July 2009
 Prior to the Nokia 5800 I had an old Nokia from 2005
 I bought this because it had a decent video camera/camera(compared to my old Nokia) and the ability to browse the internet(my old Nokia could barely perform that function)
 After a year and a half, the results are mixed
The video cam is convenient to use but the results are just ok
 In broad daylight the picture is clear
 But in any other lighting condition degradation is rapid
 Browsing the internet isn't that smooth because the 5800's touch-screen is either overly sensitive sometimes or it just takes a slegdehammer to register an input
 This results in many mis-clicks which waste time and mobile bandwidth
The audio quality of the phone is pretty good
 The switching function between horizontal and vertical screen is eratic and seems to switch to horizontal when I want it vertical and vertical when I need it horizontal, so I just turn off the auto-turn feature
 Unfortunately there is no option to switch
 Either it is stationary or it turns eratically on its own
With the updates the phone functions a little smoother
 Originally there is the full/mini QWERTY keyboard along with handwriting, now with the update there is an alphanumeric keypad
 The build-quality of the phone feels nice but it is a bit bulky and the little writing tool can easily get lost
 Reception is always strong with this phone
 Overall a decent phone that's a bit pricey and can be frustrating to use

I bought this cell model 18 months ago
 Seven months after purchase, been damaged
 Nokia replaced it with a new one, without charging any fees
 It is a great phone, I use it constantly to connect to the internet, GPS, phone calls, SMS 


 The screen responds well to me, and software updates have improved over time
 I doubt it replaced soon

I truly loved this phone for roughly the first 4 months or so
 After that time, I have had to either turn off+turn back on the phone or blindly touch the right section of the screen to access the web browser for the screen to start working properly again
 It also gets stuck frequently, some times for a few seconds - some times I need to take out the battery and power up the phone all over again
The features listed here and on Nokia's website speak for themselves
 The sound quality was better than 5 mp3 players ranging from $90-$400 (iPod Touch 3G, Samsung P3 & Q2, few others

) that I tested it against and this was a main selling point for me
 It was basically a Samsung P3 with better sound and video while being a phone at the same time - all for the same price - with free movies, gift card, and accessories thrown in
Main point for my review is to let you know it's got some nice features for the money indeed, but be prepared for the possibility that it might not last so long
 Hopefully you are lucky in this regard more so than I was
 Jacked up screen and all, I still use my 5800 daily as an mp3 player - and of course as a cell-phone
 When I'm in the car it's always connected for music and hands-free calls through the aux-port and it has taken some memorable videos for me when needed
Good luck and happy holidays
I got this phone because I wanted an unlocked phone with a touch screen and QWERTY keyboard
 The free navigation and 8gb card were a plus
 I haven't actually tried the navigation yet
It was really easy to put my SIM card in this phone, there's a slot right next to the memory card slot on the left side of the phone (instead of having it under the battery like in a lot of other phones)
 The memory card is a little difficult to get out
I watched some reviews on youtube before I bought this and I was a little worried about getting it because in the videos, there seemed to be a big lag between when they pushed a button and when something opened, or when they flipped the phone it would turn black for a couple seconds before flipping the screen
 Also, they were having problems getting some of the buttons to work, especially the xpressmusic button above the screen
 But, I haven't had any problems at all with any of the buttons and there is a slight lag when flipping the screen, but it's usually less than a second, so it's not really a problem at all
 I'm not sure if the lag depends on how loaded your phone is with music and other files, though
I bought this phone used and the person who had it before me didn't delete any of their texts, contacts, pictures, or music from it
 So I had to go through and delete everything when I first got it
 I was hoping there would be a "delete all" button for text and contacts, but I couldn't find one
I like the xpressmusic button above the screen and the 4 favorite contacts on the main screen
 It makes everything really convenient
 There is also a (tiny) clock/alarm button on the top right corner of the screen, so you can set your alarm clock pretty quickly
The alarm clock doesn't work as good as the one on my last phone did
 You can set the snooze for a certain number of minutes, but you can't choose how many times it will repeat
 I usually get woken up by the first alarm, but either sleep through the rest of them, or it doesn't always repeat at the correct intervals or something
 It automatically makes your alarm tone ascend, which is nice at first, but it keeps ascending for like 5-10 seconds and ends up being REALLY loud
 I can't find any setting to change that or to adjust the volume of the alarm
 Also, it vibrates every 2 or 3 seconds the entire time the alarm goes off
 That wakes me up more than anything, because it's annoying
 You might be able to change that setting in the ringer profile (the phone's ringer also vibrates/pulses unless you change the setting)
Texting is nice with this phone
 The other phones I've had were just the normal number keypad, so this is definitely a step up
 It's a lot easier to type if your nails are a little long
 Also, I like that my inbox doesn't fill up and stop letting in new texts (hasn't yet anyway)
 The screen is black and text is white, so that's easier on your eyes if you're in a dark room too
I haven't tried any of the applications other than the camera
 It takes pretty good pictures sometimes, depending on the lighting
 It does have a flash, which is nice, but it's LED, so it doesn't really give you the best looking pictures
 Daylight pictures look pretty good for a camera phone
 I put some pictures I have taken with my other camera on the memory card and they look great on the screen and are really clear
You can chose any of the songs on your phone as ringtones, alarm tones, or even text tones
 I did end up using one as a text tone too, because it basically didn't come with any good options for that
 If you don't shorten it, it will play the whole song though
The music player is nice
 The speakers are pretty good, the only problem is that it rattles if there's any bass at all in the song
 Even just normal bass guitar or synth bass, not just bass boost
 Everything else sounds nice and clear
I have a Mac, so the software that it came with for loading music on your phone wouldn't have worked for me, but I just made a folder on the memory card and dragged songs into it
 They won't show up in the music player until you click "Options" and "Refresh Library"
Pros:xpressmusic buttonFavorite contactsPretty good pictures and video (sometimes)Really nice screen for viewing photos/videosQWERTY keyboardTouch screen feels/works greatMusic playerMusic tones8GB cardCons:No delete all button for texts and contactsAlarm clock settingsUPDATE: I did end up finding how to change the settings on the alarm clock to turn vibrate off
 I can't find it now to write instructions though
 Also, apparently the snooze (when set at 5 minute intervals) goes off for 25 minutes before it stops
One major con about this phone (really the only problem other than having to individualy delete items) is what, I believe some other people have said on here


 At one point (so far, I guess it does this in intervals, though) it stopped sending texts that I was trying to send, they would immediately go to the outbox and not attempt to send
 I could still receive texts
 Then the whole phone froze, I couldn't even turn it off
 Eventually, I took out the battery and turned it back on and my inbox was cleared
 Then I looked around online and saw that there's a code that you have to use to reset your phone to get it working properly again (which erases your contacts too, so write them down)
 I don't remember what the code is, but I'm sure someone posted it
 I still like this phone a lot and since I reset it, it's froze a couple times, but I turned it off and back on and it was fine
Also, since other people have said that they don't like the touch screen, just saying that I really like it
 I've tried a couple of my brother's phones and his are harder to control with scrolling, swiping, and accidently clicking things
 The touch screen on this is a lot easier to handle and you can change the settings to adjust the intensity of the slight vibrate that it does when you push buttons

I love music and photography, so this phone was MADE for me
 The music function is absolutely the best, and the camera has great resolution (3
2 megapixel)
 Storage capacity is also great, especially with the included 4GB micro card
 Overall, it works great and, even though this is my first touch-screen phone, I find it intuitive enough to easily figure out what I want to do

Do not buy this phone
 Nokia should have never released this phone
 They bastardized there non-touch os and adapted it for touch
 It did not turn out well
 Most of the time you have to hit the keys several times to make a function work
 I loved Nokia phones until this one
 Along with ATT this is a horrid combination

The phone was in a good condition and seemed to be brand new
 My brother-in-law is using the phone and is very happy on receiving it because he has been waiting 4 this phone ever since his old nokia 5800 xpressmusic broke down
 Thank you Amazon
com and CLC Wholesale for delivering the phone on time

Excelente la calidad del producto, exactamente el que queria, fueron responsables en la entrega del mismo, los recomiendo a comprar porque estoy satisfecha con la compra
For a first "smart phone" it's okay
Little too thick, but it's an old model
Nokia OS it's crap and slow
 Small keyboard
Signal is great, internet navigation kind of crapy

The GPS takes like 30-40 min to detect position
 I searched online for this problem and several forums talk about it, there seems to be no way round
 The integration with Microsoft Exchange is very bad: the calendar has a limit of entries it can load, after that the phone freezes when you open the calendar, and I need to disconnect the battery to turn it off
 I tried everything, I really needed that calendar integration
 I can't use it anymore, even after resetting the phone to factory defaults and erasing everything
 To sync with exchange, it asks me every time if I want to accept the certificate
 I click on "accept the certificate and never ask again"
 It shows a message saying that next time won't ask to accept certificate
 But it keeps asking to accept the certificate
 Doesn't sync anymore unless I ask the phone to do so
 The email client for Gmail and other POP3 stopped working after some update, and I gave up on it
 Nokia released a new version of Ovi maps, and my phone updated to it, but this the new version is too heavy for this phone
 Every time after I enter the code to unlock the phone, it shows a stupid message that says that the phone has been unlocked, only to make me wait
 If you're in a meeting and the alarm starts ringing, you need to enter the code to unlock the phone before turning it off, what I do instead is to take the battery off
 Any time the phone starts making a sound it's quicker to take the battery off than trying anything else
 The web browser asks if you want to see the secure/non secure elements several times per page
 Processing power is limited and you will see that when trying to scroll in a webpage

I ordered this phone because I had an older model XpressMusic phone and loved it
 This phone has taken me some time to get use to, but over all I really like it
 I love that I can use the touch screen without taking off my gloves or just use my fingernail
 I also love the hand writing option and the alphanumeric options for texting as well as the full keyboard
 I still text faster the ol'school way using the predictive text and the alphanumeric pad
 I don't like that some of the basic features that were on my older version are not on the newer model, for example the cooking timer and the most recently used contacts option for texting
 I also don't like the alarm clock
 It works fine, but the old one didn't vibrate for the alarm and this one does
 It vibrates right off the night stand and scares me every morning
 So, I have created a special ringing profile so that it doesn't vibrate at all
 I just have to remember to switch to that profile before going to sleep
 Also, since this is my first internet type phone, I have to charge it twice as often than my old one, but I am told that is normal
All in all, I am still learning my new phone, but I like it

No reason to say about its features, it is more than known and published everywhere on internet, it is simply great
 I specially like its pop-up multimedia player menu
A bit of deception because finding applications to it is not as easy as for Android (this runs Symbian), but these do not make me think it is a bad choice
 And, of course, no other brand makes as good antenna as Nokia does, Nokia rules signal

I bought this phone based on the many positive reviews here
 I don't have a 3G plan, so I was very attracted to the GPS navigation that works without it, and WiFi connectivity
 But I have been completely disappointed with this phone
 Here's my take
Pros====-Good camera for a cellphone: 3
2 MP with LED flash
-GPS navigation works without 3G plan (at least in theory)
-WiFi connectivity lets you get online without 3G plan
-Decent battery life: usually goes a few days per charge
 It helps that I never use any smart phone features because they're such a PITA
)-Good network reception (at least compared to my ancient Motorola V188)
-Nokia is regularly updating their Ovi Suite software
 Maybe they'll fix this stuff someday
Cons====-BUGGY OS and apps
 Web browser and GPS navigation are virtually unusable
-HORRIBLE user interface all around
 Doing anything other than making calls is simply not worth the trouble on this phone
 Plan on using the stylus a lot
-GPS takes too long to get position fix
 Very spotty GPS reception inside vehicles, where you need it the most
 Despite downloading latest maps, navigation consistently gives WRONG directions
-Screen is difficult to read in bright light
 Auto brightness control does not seem to work correctly
-Confusing WiFi setup
-Only 4 shortcuts allowed on home screen, even though there's plenty of room for more
-Included USB cable is only 7 inches long
 Really


-Software updates from the phone did not work out of the box
 I had to hunt down some obscure server settings to check for updates
 You can also update through Ovi Suite on your PC
)-Accompanying Ovi Suite PC software is bloated and buggy, although they have been making improvements recently
-Included 4 GB MicroSD card is probably not enough for all your maps and music
-No letters shown on dialing pad
Bottom Line===========NOT recommended

one year of fun

 n the screen cracked while in my pocket

 they ask 150 bucks to repair it

 for a phone worth 275 almost 15 months ago

 who would repair this brick now


 not much impressed with nokia any more


A little sluggish and you usually have to reset it in order to became usable
 Freeze sometimes



I think Nokia should replace Symbian OS by Android OS
The good - GPS with turn-by-turn navigation
 Good sound quality
The bad - sluggish, poor memory, freeze, OS

I think its a great phone, call quailty excellent
 Speakerphone very good, yes OVI is a nightmare but overall a good quailty and fun phone, touch screen is a little hard but not bad
TENGO ESTE CELULAR DESDE ENERO 2010 Y SE PORTADO EXCELENTE, TIENE TODO LO NECESARIO Y MAS, CAMARA, APLICACIONES, SEÑAL,TODO MUY BIEN
 LO RECOMIENDO

Phone features are very nice
 However after a few months, it started to shutdown without warning (battery was charged) and sometimes, when this happens, it would erase the entire contents
 I've contacted amazon's customer service several days ago asking what I should do, and did not receive any replies
 Despite the fact that this is a nice phone, it's better to buy a more sturdy one
UPDATE: I've contacted Nokia USA which confirmed the phone is under warranty and asked to ship the phone to be serviced
 They returned the phone with the same problem
 I contacted their customer service and they asked to send the phone again
 Waiting for the outcome, hopefully the phone will be really fixed this time

It is one of the best telephones that I have had
The tactil screen facilitates his managing
 It is an equipment to enjoy

OK
 To start, this phone was great
 Everything worked as advertised and I just loved it
 I bought this in August of 2009 and in July of 2010 it just started rebooting on its own
 Then in September of 2010 it progressed to just shutting down
 Then when I was able to finally get it back up, low and behold no service
 Took the sim card out and put in a GO phone and I had plenty of service
 All the other features still worked fine but no service
 I guess the antenna is shot
 Very dissapointed in the fact that I paid over $300 for this and had to resort to a $29 GO phone to make phone calls
 All I have now is very expensive MP3 player
 No more Nokias for me

Great phone, had fun with it, ended up selling it for an iphone, gotta have the apps
 :)3 out of 5 stars from me
Does not come with 8 Gyga card, stead 4 Gyga
 Careful for the same price one can buy the C6 which is much better
 I discovered it one day after I bought but the return fees from the seller would make it 50 U$ more expensive, so I decided to keep it

I bought this phone thinking that it was one of the best phones but after three months it started to heat and the battery lost all his energy
 Now I have to pay a lot of money in order to fix it
 I'm from other country then for me it's more difficult to send it to the seller

after almost 3 months, no complaints so far and can't beat the price
 love it

i have had this phone for about 4 months and is great u have everything u need on it, u also can download vey useful aplications so is like a little pc, very good price for than amazing phone
The Nokia 5800 XPressMusic is smart, with good quality and complete
Notable are the Carl Zeiss Camera, GPS Navigation capability andultra-fast EDGE Internet connection
 No complaints about thiswonderful product, only (maybe) more MPixels in the Camera and alittle more precision in the touch-screen response
Is one of the cheapest middle-high-range touchscreen smartphones
And with the excellence of the Nokia brand


I will recommend it a 100%

This phone crashed all the time
 A few times it took hours to recover
 Each time it crashed you lost data and you had to reconfigure it
 Being for AT&T, this phone is impossible to upgrade the windows OS
 Much software you can't get for it

While this appeared to be a good deal, as I was looking for a phone that would not require a data plan, this phone did not do the trick
 It received calls when I put my Pay-as-you-go card in it but refused to connect to the Internet
 I spent over two hours on the phone with AT&T representatives, supervisors, tech level II people, and finally after trying everything, they concluded that this is a smartphone and needs a data plan
 So it should be listed as a smartphone 



Does just about everything a smart phone does without the expense of adding a data plan
 My son loves it and I feel that it was worth my money
 He can listen to music, take pictures, or look up something on the Internet
 Just not the smart phone price

Great phone with wonderful features and was designed for those who want the combination of a music player and a phone in one along with the added features to enjoy them both to their fullest

EXCELENTE PRODUCTO
 LLEGO EN BUEN ESTADO A VENEZUELA

Buenas tardes quiciera copia de la factura de este producto, es muy bueno aunque despues de un tiempo tube problemas con la pantalla
One of the best cells i've got
Real heavy duty, good performance even with its 400 Mhz cpu
 There are a lot of better options right now
But if you are new (as i was to smartphones) this one can do many tricks

Good product, excelent
The box it came in was pretty beat up, but outside of that, the phone works awesome
 For full disclosure, I'm not the user of the phone, a friend is, and they have no complaints, other than the box, so I have no complaints either
 The phone got here functional, so I could care less of what shape the box was in, although it did make me wonder if the phone would work at all, and it did, so everybody is happy

all is ok
No comments

Okay as a backup phone
 Nothing to special

Ok
Excelente
Excellent, I have not had any problems and the cost is very good, I recommend it

EXCELENTE
Great phone
 Pioneer of its kind
 Symbian is a truly unique OS that just needs a few kinks worked out

Had this cell phone for almost a year now, and I'm very satisfied with it
 It does all the multi-media requirements that I want: MP3 music, videos at 640x360 resolution, GPS, Carl Zeiss Camera lens with flash, 16GB flash space, multi-tasking with open applications, and not to mention the call clarity when using voice calls
 Texting is also a breeze - just use the on-screen QWERTY keyboard for SMS or Email messages
 This phone was also featured in the Dark Knight movie when they were in Hong Kong
 Simply amazing

This is a good phone but it has one MAJOR problem for our situation -- you cannot text thru wi-fi
 You can only send and receive texts if you are in a service area
 We live in a dead zone and wi-fi is our only option unless we drive 10 miles to town where there is t-mobile service (or any service for that matter)
 We assumed that if the phone will do internet and email through wi-fi, it would also send and receive text
 That is not the case
 We have an older Samsung phone that will text throuh wi-fi but Nokia tech support says that Nokia does not have a feature to text thru wi-fi on any of their phones
 Otherwise, the phone was very good -- lots of stuff for the price and the GPS works when you aren't in a service area
 So if the text/wi-fi issue isn't a problem for your situation, I would recommend it

Excellent, I am very happy with my Nokia 5800 XpressMusic
 I have a month with him and has not given me any problems, I like the touch screen, good sound, the memory of everything you want to save
 Nokia, what else



While most people clamor for Blackberries or iPhones or the latest Androids, I found myself eager to get back to the first brand that I ever used: Nokia
 I won't lie - while I find the features of today's smart phones finally starting to live up to the hype, I am just unwilling to pay 100 dollars a month for all the service and contract craziness that comes with it
 The average iPhone, for example, can cost over 3 thousand bucks over 2 years
 I can't stand locked-down, over priced products that fail to really create compelling value for users that pay for the total package
 Many companies, in their quest to make a buck off us, prohibit certain features or limit usability in ways that I always find frustrating
 An example
 10 Dollars a month to use the Nuron's GPS feature through T-Mobile - when in fact you can and should be able to use it for free
 My old Motorola wouldn't so much as let me copy 1 inferior quality, 
3mp photo on my desktop without data charges, or picture texting charges
 Stuff like that makes me want to just end the service and throw the phone in the can
Enter the Nokia 5800:With just a texting and voice plan, I am able to use 90% of the features of this phone
 GPS works, and works great so far - the trick was to turn off assisted GPS and download maps straight to the device with the Nokia OVI suite
 Then, using the built in GPS for all navigation needs was possible (including Turn-by-Turn Directions)
 The suite, by the way, also allows you to back up your device and sync it in different ways and edit contacts and things like that
 This is usually an extra-cost item you have to pay for
 And why should you
 Losing your contacts alone would be a HUGE step backwards for most of us, and my opinion is that such protection should be standard across the board
 Especially as our phones become more central organizers in our lives
Wi-Fi is a great substitute for paying for 3G services, but 3G will be there when and if you need / pay for it
 You don't really need net services anyway if you aren't downloading any of the FREE apps, themes, games, etc
 that the OVI store provides
 You also don't necessarily need e-mail to be harassing you all the time while you are on the move
 Heaven help you if you think you can web-browse and drive
 Trust me, I used to have a blackberry for work which CONSTANTLY buzzed me with the days emails - the phone became a source of anxiety rather than a handy tool
 With Wi-Fi, I can connect at the restaurant, store, or friends house I am hanging with, or at school, and have full access to extra content or web-browsing without worrying about X-Mobile's extra charges
 It also provides me with a nice 'not now' feeling when I really do need to get away from work
 One does have to constantly specify Wi-Fi instead of "X-Zones" in my case - but you can change connection priorities to help the ensure the phone doesn't jump on the information super-rip-off without your consent
Those two features alone make this phone really stand out to me, however there is more
 The touch screen is responsive, and if you can't get it done with your stubby fingers, the included stylus does the trick
 The screen is about big enough, and fonts can be enlarged for readability
 I won't lie though, as with other phones, I wouldn't spend much time 'browsing' the internet - only things like checking email (easy with yahoo or google so far) or checking the weather, or seeking out an app make sense to me at the moment
 Otherwise, I find that I probably wouldn't get much done at all without the stylus (just not enough screen real-estate to really handle today's typical sites)
 I do find that the auto-rotation of the screen gets worse when multiple apps are running (fails to rotate), but if one tips it right (think, parallel to the floor
), it works every time
 I can type rapidly and accurately, and enjoy it more with the vibration off and just a small beep on
 This was key for me, since I've used different touch screens and qwerty keyboards and often just can't do it with my blunt fingers
 My only issue with the Nokia is that the full-screen qwerty touch does not put some common symbols on the primary screen, symbols like @ for emails or ) for smiley faces (hey I like to be friendly)
 They are an extra tap away
 Otherwise, I have been impressed with the typical responsiveness and speed
 Obviously, we all wish our phone were big as a laptop at times, or as small as a credit card at others
 I think Nokia's compromise is good - the phone feels and looks small, is light, and doesn't feel any more burdensome than my old Motorola flip
 Brightness is more than adequate except in direct bright sunlight, where it really washes out, and text is very clear
 It really seems higher res to me than it is, and font sizing is changeable pretty much everywhere, and zoom is available if needed
The latest symbian update allows a seemingly infinite number of contacts on the home screen (previous was 4 - yuck), and did link to my primary emails without a hitch, and I can manually update to read them when I think I want to
 I especially like that the contacts on the home screen are 'tracked' - I can see texts for example, that I've exchanged with just that one person, and send a new one
 Graphics are cool (if not as polished as some of the newer phones) and the UI in general is pretty straightforward once you spend some time with it
 I do find myself getting lost a lot however, or forgetting where certain settings are, though, this is not different to me than other phones I have used - some things are always front and center, other things get buried in sub menus
 It would be nice if Nokia used some of the new nifty '3d' effects like pages turning or things moving when menus were changed, to help give a visual cue that you are 'interfacing' with the UI, but again eye candy versus capability
 I would rather have control than better visuals when it comes down to it
"Express Music" should mean that media is no-problem with this phone, and so far, I am impressed with the overall sound quality of the phone and the included headphones / mic, though the quality of those headphones, and the fit, is a little iffy to me (these are in-ear type, I think I prefer buds)
 Happy to know that they put emphasis on the sound rather than the look however
 Plenty of volume by the way
 The phone did an awesome job of organizing my files accurately, and provides a big in your face letter to let you know where you are as you search by album, artist, etc
 They should have ported that feature to the contact list as it greatly simplifies the search
 No major issues there
 Also, the phone did come with 8gb of extra storage, enough for 600 or so high-bitrate Mp3s
 Though, given the many uses of storage on this phone I think that I would need to upgraded to 16 gb or more to really stuff this thing with songs
Call quality has been excellent so far, both for the ear piece and for the speakerphone
 The speaker phone sounds better than my laptop when playing music, more balanced and a a sense of actual bass
 Signal strength has been excellent, and I'll be in the boondocks this weekend to find out how it cope there (usually service drops in and out)
 All in all voices sound full and clear, and I can detect problems with other people's phones (thats how good it has been so far)
Camera
 A dual-LED Carl Zeiss at 3
2 Megapixels
 After a recent fire which burned down my building, I re-discovered the critical value of having even a bad camera on hand and available, if only by phone
 Hence I am forgiving of camera phones in general
 I've shot mostly indoors so far, and find that exposure ranges from unusable to good, grain is pretty bad in low lighting, but the flash is quite powerful
 Focus lock is a tad slow at times, and I don't know why I get some blur even when using flash on occasion
 I expect that like many cameras, broad daylight will reveal its best performance, and my good photos so far are really good
 There are tons of available settings however, and all around I think this camera spanks the 
3 mega pixel disaster I've had to rely on previously
 But I won't be throwing away my digital camera any time soon
Battery life
 This baby is rated for up to 8 hours of talk time, which is excellent
 Yesterday I toasted the battery in about 6 hours from a mixture of trying out the Mp3 Player and playing with the internet, setting up, etc
 I assume that when I stop constantly fiddling with this thing (oh how I love my new toy) It will go for days on normal use without a hitch
 This is certainly one of those phones however, that multi-tasks, and one should remember to make sure that all un-needed apps are shut off b/t uses
 The phone will not warn you, but you can check this from pretty much any menu
 It recharges in about 2 hours I've found, which is really good
 A charger is included, but the USB cable is data-only
 Pick up a powered Micro-USB cable if you want to add a charging option to the phone
 I'll be picking one up as it is generally more 'portable' than an AC adapter
 I am going to GPS a 2
5 hour drive on today, and head to a low signal area
 If the battery proves to be really strong, or weak in these conditions, I'll report back
 Otherwise, assume that it did its job
Lets Do the pros and cons:Pros: Great Mp3 PlayerGreat GPSWi-Fi rules
Easy to transfer files8 gb memory included
Excellent Call qualityCan act as a USB wi-fi hotspot if you have a data plan (is it time to drop Comcast yet
)Well executed touch screen / stylus back-uplots of free and useful apps / wallpapers / you name it
OVI Suite makes life a little easier - backups, edits, map downloads, syncing, seamless so farEssentially UNDER priced given its capabilities (compare this phone to a 4-600 dollar newer phone)Feels like a true open-source, unlocked phone (unlike Google's ad machines and Apples prison-camp approach to technology)decent camera with functional macro lensCons:UI is not an A+ - more like a solid B
Learning curve - though not necessarily worse than other smartphones
 But I have been trolling the net and thumbing the manual a lot so far
OVI not as well integrated as iTunes (but I hate iTunes anyway)Not sure what documents this thing can handle (pdfs will cost you)Your girlfriend will HATE the amount of time you invest getting set up, updated, downloaded, etc
I expected a plastic case to come with it - I got nothing
 Europe only I guess
 But it did come with a car mount for GPS, Headphones, Charger, and 8 gb of memory, so, I'll get over it
All in all, when I got the GPS working the way I wanted, I fell in love with this little phone - it is a true powerhouse for the price, and if it lasts, I expect it will be remembered as my first great smartphone
 My biggest concern now is that Nokia has not been succeeding in the U
S
 lately (though make no mistake, they are a world leader everywhere else, and innovative in their own right) and I fear that a switch to Meego and away from symbian will mean the general end of support for this kind of smart phone
 This platform feels as though it could only get better, so that would be a sad loss
 I feel like such a 'cheater' using this phone (buying direct from Nokia means NOT being FORCED to buy a data or GPS plan from my carrier) that I really wonder if the Nokia approach of providing an open and unlocked experience can really compete against the nickel and dime wireless economy being pushed by apple, at&t, google, verizon, and others
 If I'm lucky, maybe I'll get a FREE update when Nokia decides what direction it wants to take
In the mean-time, I'll be greatly enjoying a solid all-around experience with a ton of value added for a minimal cost
 This phone is the real deal, if you can live with the fact that it is not quite as polished (or large) as the more popular phones available at the moment
 Though, capabilities and features have already improved through one update, perhaps another one will take it even further
Why are you hesitating
 Take the plunge

I am very satisfied with the product, excellent sign, sound and video
 I recommend it

So far so good
 This is a very good phone has most of the features that you would find in a more expensive phone
 The only issue i found is that a little thick but the price is very reasonablle

If you are buying this for the GPS function, think again
 As many others have commented, it takes forever for this phone to figure out where it is
 That makes it pretty useless for around the town driving
 In addition, it has a pathetic accuracy level
 It regularly told me that I was 300 yards from a turn when I was already in the left turn lane and only 20 feet from the intersection
 Suddenly it realized where it was and told me to turn left
In addition, the GPS works much better if it is A-GPS, which uses your phone network as a part of its navigation process
 That uses up valuable minutes on my phone service that I am not interested in donating to AT&T
 That's especially significant because we want a GPS for long voyages
 You can use it without the A-GPS, but it's not nearly as good
Beyond the GPS, the phone is astonishing
 The screen is gorgeous and watching movies on it is a blast
 It sounds good and it's easy to use
 Others have complained about the interface, but I don't think it's a problem
 If you don't care about the GPS, then buy it in a second
 Oh, the WIFI is blazing fast, as fast as my new laptop almost and the resolution is great

Review amended Nov
 2010After 6 months of use this is how I view the 5800 XpressMusic now
Pros:The 5800 ExpressMusic is a very adequate 3G phone
 The touchscreen is smooth, both the touchscreen and soft keypad are very responsive
 It hold a lot of media in it's external micro-SD card (up to a 16gb microSD now)
 The sound volume is good using it's internal speakers and with both wired and wireless headsets
 It pairs easily with multiple bluetooth devices
 It picks up wi-fi connections quickly and connects to the available wi-fi router in a reasonable amount of time
 The software is intuitive and things are where you expect them to be
Cons:The camera takes somewhat good pictures, especially with the flash
 The camera does have focus problems in low and excessively bright light
 When I say focus problem, I'm not intimating that the pictures are blurry or look like you are taking pictures under water, but that they are not sharp
 This could be called "soft" focus
 The video camera takes video, not particularly sharp video, but it adequately gives you decent video images
 The camera/video part of this phone is not equivalent to a stand-alone camera, like my Panasonic Lumix
 It won't fast focus or quickly adjust to changes in available light
The 5800's GPS is a real GPS, but that said, it takes a long time to link to enough satellites to actually see your position on the provided maps
 The free maps are very good, once they appear
 I sat with the Nokia GPS and my Tom Tom 340XL under a cloudless sky and started both searching for satellites at the same time
 The TomTom connected and found itself in less than a minute, the Nokia GPS took almost 4 minutes to come alive
 Once it did connect it did function as well as the TomTom, with respect to showing the relative position
 As I use the GPSs primarily for location while walking and I don't drive, I can't describe it's performance in an automobile
The screen of the 5800 while not distorted as intimated in a previous review, is slightly wavy, but not in any way unpleasant to view
 I don't find this waviness to be a problem
 What I do find to be a screen problem is its tendency to be a fingerprint magnet
 I spend a lot of time wiping the screen on my shirt to get rid of the latent fingerprints
 The FBI would love this phone if it could suck fingerprints from an adjacent surface
 I have the same fingerprint problem with my Compaq 931 laptop, but I don't get fingerprints on its screen as often as with the 5800
The last con I want to bring up is the battery life
 The 5800 does have an auto-shutdown feature which shuts off the screen and asks you to push the unlock lever on the side to restore the screen
 The problem with the auto-shut off feature appears to be, that the screen goes off as it should, but if I leave the camera function on and then while the screen shuts down, it does not shut down the camera and the battery continues to be depleted as if the screen was on and I was using the camera
 The same appears to happen if I leave the video player on and let the phone go into auto-shutdown mode
 I would hope that Nokia would address this in a future update, but they may not be aware that it is a problem
With consideration of all of the above, would I still buy this camera if I had it to do all over again
 Yes, I would and knowing what has been presented here, and in other reviews for the price, I would recommend the phone to others who are considering it vs
 other 3G phones

I bought this phone in November 2009 and absolutely loved it
 It worked great



 I loved the camera, the touch screen, the long battery life, and even the qwerty keyboard
 In June 2010 it started having some serious problems
 If I ever had the screen unlocked, the phone opened either my call log or contacts and dialed the first number on the list without even being touched
 While it was doing this, I couldn't even end the call before it was repeating the process again
 One night when I forgot to lock the screen, I overslept because my phone alarm didn't go off-- the phone (which had previously been good for 6 days without recharging) had died because it called my best friend 42 times that night and left 4 long voicemails while I was asleep
 Not to mention, if I ever had the screen unlocked while I made a legitimate call, it would often put the person I was talking to on hold, open the call log, and attempt to call that person again
 Text messaging proved to be impossible, as the phone often sent an unfinished message while I was typing it, opened the call log, and called the first person on the list
 In short, my phone became miserable to use
I sent it back to Nokia after attempting several factory resets and software upgrades (which was a task in itself because I had to have the screen unlocked-- which caused problems as mentioned above)
 They were "not able to duplicate my problem," which is odd, because this started happening within 5 minutes of the phone being on and wouldn't stop until it was shut off
 They claimed to run some diagnostic tests on it, which uncovered some hardware failures
 These were resolved and the phone was sent back to me
 When the phone was returned-- lo and behold-- the same problem occurred
 I've gone two weeks without a phone in the hopes of getting mine fixed, and now it looks as if I'll either have to repeat the process a couple more times or get a new phone
 But rest assured, it will not be a XpressMusic 5800

I bought this cell as a present for my father
It has a lot of nice features and the build quality is the standar expected one for a plastic cell phone
However, it has several things that just aren't right, let me explain:The cell phone JAMS for no particular reason, having to restart ir at least 2 times in a single day
 Sometimes it doesn't responds to the power button so you have to take the battery off in order to restart the thing
GPS capabilities although nice, is too slow to get the satelites
Good reception, battery life and in call quality
Nokia should be more responsible for the products released under its name
 This is not an isolated issue


 I've met around 10 people with the same mistake or even worse

This is a Cheap made in China phone with a very ugly camera and video quality, it takes terrible pictures
If that is Nokia's response to the iPhone, then Apple can rest for the next 2 years
I bought the phone because it is unlocked and I don't want to pay ATT data plan for two years
 It also has Wi-Fi, Blue Tooth and GPS
What I like about the phone:1/ It is very sleek and fits snugly in the hand2/ The voice quality and the speakers are excellent and have enough power3/ It has WiFi and Bluetooth4/ I am a stylus type of guy and I like the handwriting capability - probably the best feature5/ Changing the SIM or the SD is a snap
What I don't like1/ Making a phone call is pathetic - how many clicks do I have to make in order to make a simple phone call
 And why does it have to ask me if I want to make a video call 


 Like I do video calls from my land line
2/ So far I haven't found a way to do phone card call, without having to type in about 20 digits
3/ Could not manage to get the blue tooth conduit to run with my Vista Laptop
 Vista asks for a driver, Nokia says that they have provided the driver
4/ Even the full size QWERTY is very difficult to use
 You need to press much harder on the LCD so fat fingering is very common
5/ Help and support are pathetic6/ The battery died after about 8 hours, during which time I had made 3-4 calls
 It virtually died it went from full charge to almost empty in a matter of 10 minutes
All in all, I am considering to return it and get a phone that actually works, without having to have manicure or three hands
============================================ 10 DAYS LATER UPDATE:-------------------------------Here we go:PROS:1/ The battery issue disappeared after about 1 week nightly recharging
 Now the battery indicator has a tendency to be 100% all day long, and I do talk more than when I was testing the phone
 I am not sure if the indicator is correct, but at least it has not let me down while I am talking
2/ The phone has relatively decent "Voice Command" feature
 That resolved my issue with the number of clicks to make a simple phone call
3/ I received an SMS from NOKIA - telling me how to turn my GPS feature on
 That was awfully nice of them - ~2 hours after the activation the GPS found me
 Obviously there is a "soak" period
 So don't expect immediate results
 The "soak" period also falls in the CONS category
4/ I must admit that the "Camera" is fairly decent
 Having said that - I did not buy the phone because of the camera
 If you need a camera - "you buy a camera"
 I am looking more into the "organizer" functionality
 ("I-DON'T-have-to-attach-my laptop-to-my-butt-but-it-helps-if-handy) kinda' application
CONS:1/ The voice command works fairly well
 The problem is that NOKIA has prerecorded commands from, I am sure, some terrific Finnish guy, who has a terrible Finnish accent (as far as English is concerned)
 That is easy to overcome, as far as Applications are concerned (you can override him with your voice), but I am yet to figure out how to change the preconceived notions, as far as "Contacts" are concerned - I cannot figure how to create a voice command to call my wife, unless I mimic the Finish guy's ideas as to how to pronounce a name
2/ The DTMF issue is a real problem
 I do a lot of call card calls and conference calls
 The phone has "Copy --> Paste" function, but this does not cut it
 There MUST be a way to pre-program your call-in numbers, and log-in with 1-2 'clicks'
I do understand that "One" is not supposed to talk on the phone while driving, but this is "One's" decisions
 By no means it is NOKIA's decision
3/ In order to access features there is a substantial time lapse between the moment the feature is activated ( you click) and the moment you can use the feature
 I wonder why is that


WHO IS WATCHING


 AND WHAT that "WHO" IS
The long "soak" frustrated me and invoked questions about the safe keeping of my privacyCONCLUSIONThis phone is an acquired taste 


 or maybe Symbian is an acquired taste 


 I don't know
It has potential, if NOKIA fixes the annoyances in the firmware - e
g
 the voice command works fine, minus the Finnish accent
 GPS works,AND people know how to make it work and what to expect
 (SMS simply does not cut it)
There is no way to convince me that this phone is user friendly
 It simply is not
 You can easily access the most basic features, but if you want to do something beyond basics - it is a nightmare
I am sorry, but I do not buy a "cheap" $340 phone, just to figure out how to make a phone call, or take a note, or make an appointment, or take a picture
 I buy it to be able to do all of the above - EASY
And learning how to do that has to take place in "reasonable" time - say 1-2 hours
 This is not the case
 So far I have invested about 8 hours to figure out the some of the questions, that are most annoying
 Probably it will take twice as much to figure the answers
How about an brand new idea
 How about, a user guide that actually guides you


 Or how about some useful webcasts, that would teach you how to use the phone features, without having to spend 7 days trying to figure them out 


 What a challenge 


THE VERDICTI WILL KEEP the phone
I will keep it, simply because, based on my experience and judging by reviews about the competition, it is MORE acceptable
It is nowhere near to the iPhone, but that is another can of worms
I expect huge improvements from NOKIA on:1/ User interface2/ User manuals or instructions3/ Ease of use - functionality
All of the above can be fixed by software, so I am expecting the upgrades
Happy upgrading 

Enough said - 2-1/2 stars - FINAL 
============++++++++++++++++++============LAST UPDATEThe headphones coming with the phone are AMAZING 


Easily comparable to BOSE
I heard depth and breadth of music, that I hadn't experienced in a long time
 (That is after I figured how to copy the music to the phone, and how to start it)
 Seriously - the sound from the headphones is exceptional 
Maybe it is what it says "XpressMusic" - I will give to NOKIA that - Music is PERFECT 


 Much better than my wife's iPod 
Still - 3 stars for the overall phone - MAX
Music on the headphones is excellent though

The phone is an acquired taste 



Really good touch phone, I definetly think its the best touch phone out there right next to the Iphone
 The Speakers are Loud and Crisp for music
 The Screen is responsive, and the vibration feedback, is not annoying at all
- The Camera could be better though, and the flash doesn't seem to help, alot of the time sadly-VERY IMPORTANT, the real reason why i didn't give this phone (that I was reaaally excited for) is because the second day I had it, I used the tv- out cable to see some vids, it FROZE and shut off, now SINCE then there is a horizontal line around the bottom of my screen, and it NEVER goes away :'[
Phone worked well out of the box
 (AT&T user, just insert your old phones SIM and go
 However, for texting you have to go to the set up menu and input the AT&T message center phone number, otherwise your text/s will stay in the Outbox)
 Music is great with clear sound
 Camera has a flash and works for night scenes, but the resolution is not that great
 Wi-Fi is automatically scanned just like a laptop does
 Haven't downloaded all the Nokia apps to check out all the functions this smartphone can do
 Expanding memory is easy with a phone slot on the side to max out to 16 GB
 Great Amazon price, quick shipment, way more positive add ons than the overpriced Iphone
 Video webcam available via 2 cameras, not locked on to a monthly $30 data plan like the Iphone, battery on par with my previous cell phones, touch screen is as good as it gets
 You can also just add AT&T's media data plan down the road if you need 24/7 websurfing, think its about $15
 All in all, Nokia 5800 is a winner; not as well known, then again you're not going to stand out as one of the Apple peeps out there

I have officially had this phone for 1 week, and so far so good

 for a smart phone virgin
 I have synced fairly easily, download some apps and listen to podcasts without issue
 Great internet connect and connected within my wireless network with no issues
 The only problem I had was obtaining my contacts from from my old Nokia 5300(way behind in technology I know), phone swap did not work for me
 Anway, after I saved my contacts to my SIM, and placed it back in this phone, all was well that ended well
 I also thought it was wierd that the guitar game was in Spanish

 Good thing I speak the language
 I really like the guitar pick stylus and the music stand
I Overall, I'm more than satisfied with this purchase, and still playing with my new toy, and I just appreciate the freebies including amazon video credit and free map trial
 It's pretty easy to use for someone who has never had a touch screen before, and even has a help screen in every section plus tip video clips
 There are tons of shortcuts which is cool
 I really like that you don't have to take the cover off the back to swap the memory card as well
 Just wish it came with a case



Not so great phone after all,

 I owned almost every Nokia phones
Touch screen so wimpy,

 very hard to navigation around
 Impossibly to scroll down the phone book and stopping by the correct name
Also phone dead now,

when power up
 Screen said Return to provider for service, boot up fail

hi, first lets setup my parameters
 I am a Tmobile subscriber from Tampa Bay area
 My reception is the highest available
 I have owned in order a Ericson from the PCS days, a Panasonic from ATT/Cingular days, Nokia 6120, 6131, Tmobile Dash, Tmobile Shadow, Nokia N95 8GB (for 3 weeks but then the display went out and i got scared to want to replace it so i returned it
 Please also note this is my second time owning a Nokia 5800
 The first time was a European model with US warranty since i got it from the Nokia Flagship store in Chicago
 That had the first firmware with no updates


and it sucked
 Sucked so bad I sold it used because I couldnt wait for the firmware upgrade
 So now we advance to today
 And with great relief, I tell you people that this Nokia 5800 Nam is an outstanding smartphone
 The most current firmware 20
0
012 has made this Nok great
 I know this because I have owned both
 I take off 
50 because no the UI is not as pretty as the Iphone, nothing is when it comes to touch
 the other 
25 is because when you activate the pretty animations for the touch interface, it does slow it down
 So I do turn it off to keep it running smoothly
 This is a best seller for Nokia, therefore they will continue to give us better software updates to make it run even smoother
 Their is no crazy ear piece problem
 The phone feels so easy fitting in one hand
 This cant be said of the Iphone
 The Iphone is awsome yes, but its kinda big to use as a cellphone
 ok let me real this in
 The phone works great clear LOUD speaker phone, great fun snap shoot digital camera, great flash abilities to stream web content, great call quality, very pretty screen
 As for the touch method, the iphone once again is kewler and smooth however the resistive touch screen is CLEARLY improved and does not hold you back
 Clearly the firmware upgrade tweaked the sensitivity and made it much more responsive
 im all over the place with this review, im sorry
 if only Nokia could do better marketin partnerships and get this to a local Best Buy so people can touch it and feel how great it is


that for me is one of it biggest selling points



I think this is a great phone
 The problem is that when I received it, it had already been opened
 Amazon sent me a package that someone had returned
 They are taking it back
 The other problem is the ear piece speaker
 You can;t determine when the phones were manufactured
 Any phone manufactured before around mid February was probably manufactured with the faulty ear piece speaker
 You can order then get it fixed if it fails under warranty, but that is a pain for me as i don't live near a Nokia care Center

Ever since I have used smart phones, nokia and symbian s60 has been my favorites, my last two phones being the n95-3 and the e71
 I was hoping to hold out until the n97 but decided to give the 5800 a try
The phone itself is built very solidly for a midrange phone, there's no worry about dropping it and having it break on you, the screen is also very nice, this may not be the slimmest phone out there but it feels very comfortable in your hand, and the resolution looks amazing
 I have a minor concern with the battery cover, it seems like it was more of an afterthought in the design of the device, there is no buttons or latches to secure it, just a few tabs that u click it into


I hope this doesn't break on me quickly




but I don't see a need to be removing the cover very often, as the memory card and SIM card are inserted through the side, meaning this phone can have its memory cards switched very easily
The user interface seems like a quick and dirty job, it is basically the s60 v3 operating system with some bigger icons to make selection by touch a little easier
 Not a major overhaul on the operating system basically everything looks the same as previous nokia smart phones, the camera, video, and music interfaces could have made better use of finger controls in my opinion
Another major concern that hopefully will be alleviated soon is the lack of third party apps, I'm assuming this operating system is still an infant and over time developers will start adapting their existing apps to use on touch devices
Handwriting recognition is my favorite input methods, although the full screen QWERTY comes in a close second
 The t9 keypad works great for one handed operations, and the mini QWERTY keyboard is a joke
I was disappointed to see that the US version does not ship with an extra stylus, NOR DOES IT HAVE A CARRYING CASE

I love, love this phone



couldn't afford the iphone so guess what the next bestest thing is







My nokia 5800 xpress music phone

First of all, Amazon is one of the best website I ever seen
About Nokia 5800, I love this cellphone

Bought this phone almost a week ago
 I am still trying to update the firmware
 I use Windows 7
 The enclosed cd refuses to work
 It says I have no internet connection, but I do
 Then I downloaded the OVI suite to try an update that way
 Had a horrible time trying to get the download to install
 I finally got it to install as "administrator" on the 3rd attempt
 Once installed, I tied to update the phone and it still won't update firmware via OVI suite
 I then attempted to update via the phone itself via wireless connection
 Keep getting as error this way too
 I don't think it is a firewall issue
 But feel lost
 I've called Nokia customer service
 Each time you get a nice lady with a heavy foreign accent
 I mention this because it is hard to communicate back and forth
 The first time I called the lady said I must contact my internet provider for assistance
 Well they had no clue as to why since my internet was working and everything attached worked
 Called Nokia back again and the nice lady promised that a technician would contact me withing 24 to 48 hours
 Never happened
 Called back a 3rd time and the nice lady said she was going to look for my records and after 10 minutes never came back on the phone
 This is all too frustrating
 The phone itself works alright, but I am unable to download OVI maps because I have outdated firmware
One last complaint
 I cannot find an app for internet music
 I found one on the Nokia site but it was for older models
 I have a Nokia N8100 internet tablet and it has a great internet music app
 Can't believe this phone doesn't
 I am about to give up and send this back
Update
 On the 7th day


I tried once again to update the firmware via wifi & phone and it connected and updated on first attempt
 Great
 But another thing happened that is really strange
 A call came in and the phone vibration started
 But it would not stop
 It just kept vibrating and the keys locked up
 After a couple of minutes I just pulled the battery and inserted it and it was alright
 Strange phone

This phone has met all my expectations
 The built-in GPS is fantastic
 From time to time, it takes a while to lock, but once it does, it works really well
 I am currently using the endoMondo sports app, and the way it works with the GPS and the auto-upload feature make this thing an amazing exercise tracker for walking, running and biking
 The free navigation and turn by turn with voice instructions works as well as any GPS that I have seen
 The touch-screen isn't as "cool" as the iPhone, but then again, I am not "stuck" with a data plan
 The phone works great, and the battery life is at least as good as I expected, probably better
 The web browsing is fine for the simple things I would use a device like this for
 I have been surprised by the user interface, allowing a touch on things like the clock or the profile setting display to change or display additional info
 In short, I have no regrets whatsoever for having purchased this phone
 Yes, there are better phones out there


 but nowhere near the low price of this phone

I'm writing this review from the perspective of an American who lives and travels overseas
 Because of this, I was looking for an unlocked, quad-band GSM phone that had 3G, Wifi, GPS, a decent screen size for video and a good app selection
 Plus, I wanted this all at a reasonable price since I would not be getting any plan subsidy
 Using this criteria the 5800 seemed perfect and there are a lot of great things about this phone for the traveler which I'll go into later
 The main negative I found was that the American version of this handset and the others in its product line do not support 3G outside of the Americas
 The 5800 American edition does not support the UMTS (3G) 2100 frequency (Wikipedia has an entry under "list of UMTS networks" that show which carriers use which frequency)
 Now the point can be made that I bought American edition and shouldn't be surprised that it won't pick up 3G in other countries
 The only problem is that almost all of Nokia's other American version 3G handsets like the N97, X6 and E75 (my wife's phone)do support the 2100 frequency
 To be fair, the 5800 will support EDGE networks wherever you want to go and if you use a browser like opera mini, you may not even notice that much of a difference in general web browsing
 It's just something to consider if you are looking at this as an international travel phone and a fast data connection is important to you
Now the 5800 does have some very nice features for the traveler that should be noted
 First and foremost is the ability to pre-install free Ovi maps in your phone before you get on the plane
 This allows you to use the 5800's GPS with voice directions without an active data connection
 This is something that other free mapping services, like Google maps, cannot do
 Of course you could go with third party software like Ndrive and pay up to $70 per map
 Personally, I'll go with free
 Of course with Nokia there is usually a catch
 This one is that not every Nokia handset that has a GPS gets free Ovi maps
 The 5800 does but my wife's E75, a phone released the same year and is much more expensive than the 5800, does not
 If you are looking at other other Nokia phones and this feature is important to you, then check make sure the phone can use free Ovi maps
Another important travel feature is that the 5800 has Wifi
 If you spend time overseas, you will probably be buying local pre-paid sim cards (the 5800's quad-band GSM capability lets you do that everywhere) with no or expensive data service
 Therefore, Wifi is essential
 Find a free hot spot at a coffee shop and you can check your email, tweet, update your Facebook and make Skype calls back home
 The Nokia catch here is that connecting with Wifi can be a mysterious and confusing process
 You would think that once you hook up to a Wifi connection then that the phone would automatically use that connection as the default
 We'll you would be wrong
 The first thing you need to do is go into all your applications that go online and insure that the default connection is set to "always ask"
 That way you can select the connection you want the app to use
 If you don't then the 5800 may or may not use the free Wifi connection and instead drain the money out of your sim card without you noticing
As for long train, plane and automobile rides, the 5800 is a very decent media player
 It has a standard 3
5mm audio jack and the music playback is very good quality
 The screen is on the small side for video, coming in at 3
2 inches, but it is very high res at 360 by 640 and hence the video is sharp and clear
 The screen is also in 16:9 widescreen format that means that the black bar problem on widescreen movies is not so noticeable
 You will need to convert your videos to the MP4 format for the installed Real Player, but you would want to do that anyway to bring the file size down
 Nokia also provides a generous 8 GB micro SD card, that can be upgraded to 16 GB
 That means that right out of the box you can put a lot of media on the phone, without having to spend money on a bigger SD card
As for apps, the 5800 uses the S60V5 software and the phone has been out long enough that there are a fair amount of apps for the phone
 You may have to dig for it, but pretty much everything I want the 5800 to do, and I want it to do a quite a lot, there is an app out there to let me do it
 The difference with Apple and Android is that you may have 10 flavors of apps to do the 1 task you want, while with S60v5 you will probably only have one
 The Nokia catch here is that S60V5 is a tough operating system to get to know and work with
 It is not intuitive and can be initially very frustrating, but with time you get used to it's quirks and there's lot's of support on-line in different forums to help you learn the ropes
In the end I was looking for a phone that if I was traveling very light could do all the things a basic netbook could do
 Despite it's lack of 3G outside North and South America, the 5800 does meet those expectations
 With a small folding Bluetooth keyboard (The Iphone won't let you do that yet) and a battery backup charger (get one that uses either AA or AAA batteries so you can keep replacing the batteries)I can watch movies, listen to music, write long emails or notes and play games for all of my long haul flights and layovers
 There is even an e-book app (ereader) that works pretty well if you bump the font up
 Then when I finally do get to my destination, I can fire up the GPS and load a local sim card and I'm moving and communicating in no time
 All this for a reasonable price without a contract
There is no question that Nokia delivers great hardware value with their handsets
 The challange for Nokia will be to develop a operating system with plenty of apps that let's the user smoothly and easily take advantage of all that great hardware
 With stores in the US selling $99 dollar 8GB IPhone 3GSs (with a two year contract), there is becoming less and less reason for folks to put up with Nokia's "Quirks
"
There is no sense in reviewing the features since that's already pretty well covered
I searched Amazon for the best cell phone with WiFi sorted by ratings
 This item came up at the top of the list at the price range I was looking for
 That is one of the best features with Amazon in my opinion
Boy, I am not at all dissapointed
 This is simply the best phone I've ever had or that I've ever seen
 It does everything I could ask for in a phone, and it is totally useable as an Internet device
 It is small enough to carry on your hip, less than 1/2 inch taller than a closed Razr V3, yet large enough to read a book or a web page pretty easily
 And of course you can turn the phone for a landscape view
 Plus, it is light as a feather as compared to an HTC for example
I have it set up to ask me what network I want to use everytime I access the browser
 That way, I can use WiFi whenever it is availabe
 I switched from T-Mobile prepay to AT&T prepay so I could get the monthly data package of 100mb for $[


]
 This works perfectly for me
 From what I've read, I can re-fill the data package for $[


] each month for 1mb and roll over the unused data
 I also pay an additional $[


] per month for 200 text messages since AT&T charges 
20 per text
 And, at $
[


] a call, I just try to avoid the voice and send email or texts
 The $[


] prepay re-fill will last a year and each of these monthly items get deducted from my prepay balance, along with the phone minutes
 I really don't use the phone very much, and I would usually get away with about $[


] per month on T-Mobile
 With the AT&T data plan and texting, I figure it should be closer to $[


] per month
 Not a bad deal compared to the T-Mobile minimum unlimited data plan at $[


]/mo plus $
[


] per call, or AT&T/T-Mobile @ $[


]/mo plus outrageous taxes for calls and data
The big plus is that this phone is DESIGNED to be used unlocked from any carrier
 Unlike the Blackberry, where you have to figure out ways to bypass their network, the Nokia 5800 Xpressmusic sets you up to avoid the carrier and tries to warn you as much as possible that you may incur data charges
 VERY HELPFUL
 I Highly recommend this phone
 It is an excellent value
EDIT: I just received my AMEX $[


] rebate debit card today 8/2/10 (Rebates always feel like a crap-shoot to me), so now I'm even happier with my first Nokia buying experience
 Total cost was $[


] less $[

]

This cel phone is very good with a very good price
 It has 3G tec, batery life is also good, menu is friendly and easy to work
 The signal reception is excellent
 Touchscreen is good
 Easy to update software version

excellent product and excellent sellerI am very happy with customer serviceexcellent ,excellent ,excellent ,excellent
I've owned this phone for about 6 months now, and today I'm mailing in for repair, for reasons I'll get to in a minute
 Until a few weeks ago I thought it was a decent phone, a cost effective alternative to a 2-year iphone contract and iphone data
 It's a very capable phone, the GPS works great, and once you download another browser (I used Opera Mobile [not Opera Mini]) it's a good little internet phone
 The camera's great
 Call quality and reception generally were better than my friends' iphones
 Because it's an unlocked phone, there were a handful of useful things I could that iphone users couldn't, like download an app that allowed me to take my 3G connection and make a WIFI hotspot


tethering, basically
 I also made much use of the vast array of podcasts available for download directly to the phone
 My main complaint when it was working was that there just weren't that many desirable apps, at least not compared to iphone, blackberry, or android
 Streaming data was possible, for example, but whereas many sources of streaming data (like CSPAN or NPR) have apps for more popular phones, I had to seek out links at great length
Anyway, about a week ago I started having minor software glitches
 The phone wouldn't interact properly with hands free headsets, certain menu options were unavailable
 Basic ones, like bringing up the dial pad to make a phone call
 So I call Nokia
 They tell me to reset it, which is a no brainer, but when that didn't work, they were useless
 I visit their "support" site, which is equally useless, except for the forum of users who offer each other advice based on what they've been able to dig up in spite of Nokia
 I send an email to ask a specific question
 Nokia did not answer my email, other that an auto-response message saying that they would get back to me "promptly"
 That was a week ago
 During this process I discover (no thanks to Nokia) that I cannot update my firmware over the air (direct to the phone) or with my computer, which happens to be a Mac
 I need Windows
 Okay, so I get Windows, back the phone up using Nokia's OVI Suite and then begin the update
 OVI Suite crashes, Windows closes it, and my phone is now a paper weight
 The only option left to me is to mail the phone in and do without for "7-10 days"
 We'll see about that
 Not holding my breath
If I had the decision to make over I would probably buy an iphone
 I still think this is a great phone, and I'm sure not everyone will have the same problem as I did, just be warned that if you do, it's a huge hassle

I have been using the phone about a month now
 Everything is good except for the battery
 It's never given me any warning, just shut the phone off when the battery is out
 The volume is very limited comparing with other type of phone from Nokia
 I like the Nokia N95 NAM version that I had before, the battery life was longer,and the sound was much better
 I paid only $240 for the Nokia 5800 comparing with $600 for the N95, so I should not complain

great
Not good at all
Really happy with this phone and the condition I received it in
 It was one of the first phone models I ever owned, 3310 being the first, and I love them both
 It's the perfect size for my hands and it's extremely reliable, unlike the dumb phones that are hundreds of dollars and break within 6 months
 Couldn't have made a better choice than to go back to this reliable beast

No Problems Good phone







so farDave



Works great

everything I wanted This i smy forth Nokia I ordered
how much

It is a phone that feels very good in my hands
 However , the upper most left button malfunctioned after a few clicks
 It became very stiff and it won't move
 So I contacted the seller and told him that I am sending it back and replace it with a functioning one


simple, classic telephone for an extremely low price
The Nokia 6010 is the BEST cell phone that has ever been on the market


 Very user friendly & great for the individual who is looking for an easy to operate cell phone
 I would by this phone again & again


AOK
My dad loves these phone
 He will never change
 He will always buy a new phone and the Nokia 6010 will be it 
 This phone like they say, "If it falls, the floor will break, not the phone" And yes my kitchen floor DID actually break


Kidding
Well I don't recommend this phone cause im 14 years old duh
 But my dad does, He only makes phone calls SO HE LOVES IT 

The SIM card that goes in my current ATT phone is not compatible with this technology- therefore it is unusable

Husband loved his phone old school can't get him to upgrade key pad numbers to small
 hope you have more in stock:-)
I am completely satisfied with the cell phone and charger
 They both work
 I expected nothing less

The cover is plastic
The signal reception is noty as good as it is mentioned in the reviews
I returned this item try another cell phone

I washed my husbands other phone, which had more bells & whistles, but never picked up very well-never really liked it
 Ordered this one as an inexpensive replacement, as we used to have a similar one years ago
 Picks up great, good reception
 Great basic phone, not a lot of extra stuff we don't use; heavy enough so I can hopefully feel it in his pocket next time I do laundry
 Have had it about a month, no complaints for what we need it for: talking, occ
 texting

I just wanted a phone that will call and/or text people and the Nokia 6010 fulfilled my needs and wants
 I'm glad it's unlocked because I am an AT&T user and the cell phone was made for T-Mobile, lol
 I laugh all the time because I remember when these types of cell phones (that didn't have a colored screen) were the "it" phones back in my days, lol
If you used to have or use a cell phone with a keyboard or whatever, it'll take some time for you to get used to but it's really no big deal
 Because I went from the iPhone to Nokia 6010, yep


 it's a big change for me
 :)
I thought that this phone was a piece of junk
 I mean, it doesn't even have a camera
 I have a propel and my mom has this one in black
 When Gustav turned off our power, my phone wouldn't work at all
 But my mom's kept going
 And when we go to a store like JcPenny in Lafayette, my propel and my sister's sony erisson lose reception almost instanly
 My mom's just keeps on going
 I'm keeping my propel for how stylish it is


but this little baby is going in my purse as a back up
 I'll just get a cute face plate for it

the phone is great if you need a easy to do phone i just wish it was a little smaller to fit in my pants pocket better but its a good phone
Had a lot of good features, very good sound, signal strength, a solid phone, but after two try's of trying to getting one with English instructions I gave up
 How can they sell phones in the U
S
 of A
 with no English instructions

The description didn't say the phone would all be in Spanish
 The box & instructions were all in Spanish
 Took a whole lot if trial & error to change the setting to English

not so good
I recently bought this phone and it is beautiful, the camera takes clean pictures and stuff but i'm so disappointed because the phone is out dated and i've been trying to update it but so far no luck
 In the settings I required to open a nokia account and i've been trying to do so with no luck, it also does not support google play



Nice but not in english good delivery amazing service good job looking to purchase again
I just bought this phone
Can someone tell me how to activate it in English 
plz and thx

Great phone, do not miss it
Genial

Easy to use it, beautiful, cute and elegance is this phone, I love it, I am so exited with this phone, my mom is happy with her new toy

It has all the features as per the specifications except one thing: English is not an option

This is not good , when I received the phone is was a foreign language I was wanting a phone that had English word not a diffent language I don't understand
It comes in Spanish, it does not list that on the product description
, You have to figure out to change it to English

Ex lent
easy to use, clear picture easy on the eyes
Fast service, item received as described in your description
 An excellent and simple to use phone for general use
 Thanks

Awesome
I bought the phone just to use on vacation to the States, so it was fine for me
 My first time using a smart phone
 The biggest problem was the battery died every night

not even 24 hours between charges
 Insane
 I don't have the patience for that

I bought this phone brand new as a gift for a friend ,the phone was not taking charge, neither was it turning on
How embarrassed was this

One of the best feature phones you can get without having to get a data plan
 The screen is sharp and contrast is great
 The main issue is the lack of an LED flash and it is easy to turn it off by mistake when it is locked
 It doesn't ask you to confirm if you want to shut down
 Also the on screen keyboard is a little smaller than I would have liked
 Connect it to your WiFi to pull down updates without having to use your cellular data as there are updates available for the phone

Worked with AT&T US without having to configure anything
 Uses a micro sim so you'll need to cut it yourself or get a cutter if you are currently using a standard size sim
Overall, a nice phone that you don't have to have a data plan for

I know Nokia build solid phones
 and the price is so good for the features
 So, I bought it from Breed store on Amazon
 The phone comes dead as brick
 It won't turn on
 It won't charge
 No response to any touch
 Happily , Amazon took the return
 I will order an replacement and update this review soon

Good @ the price
 Recommended

excellent recommend
Very Good
excellent
Perfecto
The phone I received was not the one I saw on the ad
 That one has aa flash for the camera and the one I received does not have flash ability 
 not happy

Got mine and the battery was a serious issue
Try charging and still it was totally dead
 Crappy phone
 Dont buy it

I get very good comment on this Nokia phone

Dont come English subtitles , and turn off it self 

The phone is probably fine, but for some reason the box and instructions are in Spanish
 When my spouse gets home I will insert the sim card and see if it comes up in English or has an English setting
 Will post update when I know for sure
That is the only reason this item is getting 3 stars
 The phone was delivered on the day expected and seems to be a good little phone, but until I get the sim card in I won't know for sure

I bought this as a backup for my Nokia 808 PureView Black Factory Unlocked 41MP GPS
 The screen is a bit smaller
 The camera is only 5mp
 However, the functionality and the capability are hardly noticeable when comparing the two in day-by-day operations (excluding the camera, because the Nokia 808 is an incredible camera that lets you make phone calls and organize your life)
 The same Apps are available, including Microsoft Mobile Office and the Opera Mini Web Browser (pretty much the same that is available for Androids and the Kindle Fire HD 8
9", Dolby Audio, Dual-Band Wi-Fi, 32 GB)
 One great difference is that the Nokia 603 cost me only a fraction of the price I paid and would have to pay for a new Nokia 808
 I feel that this is a great bargain to be able to carry so much of my life around with me on a small phone: hundreds of contacts, my Outlook calendar, 32GB of Audiobooks in mp3 format + so many other things
 Who needs and iPhone or Samsung Galaxy

Very nice
excellent pulled the expectations
next few days I will be buying 2 more unites of nokia 603, wonderful for gift thankyou
You get what you pay for
 Purchased for grandson and couls never get data working and would randomly lock or shut off
 lasted 1 month

Good phone in a very good price


Thank you Amazon
1
First of all this phone was in spanish (not mentioned on product page), when it came
 Someone change the settings to engish for me, but some things are still set in spsnish eg
 when I open microsoft page on use shop app
 even when texting, the T9 suggested words are(you guessed it) Spanish
2
On the microsoft store you have to buy everything, the only things free are ridiculous demos
3
Can only watch videos on youtube,and thats because of youtube app
4
 Can't call on its whats app
5
Use of phone is like button setting, but touch screen
 eg
where it can take one or two touch on android OS to do a task, it can take about four on this symbian BELLE pack2 lousy OS
6
 Cant readilly connect to some open wii-fi, you have to manually syncronize the wireless box with phone (put in pin on both then configure, while my friends can connect no problem on same nettework

okay
no way
 I didn't like the way you try to operate it compared to a real fully-made android phone

The product is good but I always get exelent sevice from this seller

no so good
I bought 2 of theses phones and they only lasted for less than a year, they pretty much didn't have enough memory to do anything and started malfunctioning
 Forget about taking selfies as there is no front camera and no flash so forget about taking pictures in the dark
 This really belongs to the prehistoric age

soild
Last year I purchased this Nokia, it supposed to be unlocked but, it was not what is the alternative to have it unlocked

Nice
Excellent phone, practical and functional, the problem is the operating system that is already obsolete

For My Son, Easy To Use Very Durable, This Phone Is Amazing, He Loves it
Much too small
 I ended up giving it away
Very nice product

This phone is a nice device for someone who is looking for a basic 3G phone (for voice, text, access the web with Opera Mini, and viewing Office documents on the move) with a touch screen
 It is a business class device with all the features of the E-series
 It has the most up-to-date Symbian OS (Feature Pack 2) dated Oct 2012
 From a user interface view, it is as good as it gets for a Symbian phone
 It has 500 meg of ram and a 1G Hz cpu, hence it zips along for a 4+ year old phone
 I find it interesting that there are 3 drives (C [500 meg], E [1
5G] and F [the sd card] ) on the phone
 All 3 drives can be encrypted
There are a few items that I found irritating with this unit: 1) The QuickOffice tool is a "read" only version
 Since Nokia Store is now defunct, there is no way to upgrade
 But, there is a full version (allowing edit function) that one can find somewhere on the Internet
 2) The plastic cover for my unit does not latch securely at one corner, due to a defective hook
 Not a big problem for now, a problem later perhaps
 3) The HOME button is hard to use, as the CALL, HOME, and END buttons all use the same actuator plastic strip
 Most of the time when I try to Long Press the HOME button to get to the task switching screen, I get something else
 Else, the phone meets my expectations
 Be aware that Nokia Store is no longer around to get apps
 It has been replaced by Opera Store which has lots of apps, but mostly not very useful ones

I love my little 603 i use it as a phone and pda with occasional web browsing and it is perfect
 It even has a decent camera see the included unedited photo
 A tip for those with bad battery life if you turn off the wifi when not in use the battery will last quite a while
 The only thing i don't like is that the gps has a hard time getting a signal indoors and when in a moving vehicle but it will still get you where you need to go if you're patient with it

Bought as gift
If you just want a "smart" type phone, and don't much care about having access to tons of apps,this'll do

Phone was not good, went bad after only one week of using it
 The screen started fading
Just a good enough back up phone
 Worked as soon as I put in my sim
 I'm able to receive and make calls from my island of Trinidad
 The only thing is don't buy this if you want to access the internet
 It is ver sensitive to the touch and the screen is so small you can accidently touch multiple applicatin you never intended to
 Just right for a back up phone
The phone runs as expected for one of its kind
 Is not the fastest, or the greatest, but, for that price I thing it's quite good
 I like it

Very complicatedCannot download game waste of money
I does not work in Chile

clear
Excellent
This is not good , when I received the phone is was a foreign language I was wanting a phone that had English word not a diffent language I don't understand
It comes in Spanish, it does not list that on the product description
, You have to figure out to change it to English

Ex lent
easy to use, clear picture easy on the eyes
Fast service, item received as described in your description
 An excellent and simple to use phone for general use
 Thanks

Awesome
I bought the phone just to use on vacation to the States, so it was fine for me
 My first time using a smart phone
 The biggest problem was the battery died every night

not even 24 hours between charges
 Insane
 I don't have the patience for that

I bought this phone brand new as a gift for a friend ,the phone was not taking charge, neither was it turning on
How embarrassed was this

One of the best feature phones you can get without having to get a data plan
 The screen is sharp and contrast is great
 The main issue is the lack of an LED flash and it is easy to turn it off by mistake when it is locked
 It doesn't ask you to confirm if you want to shut down
 Also the on screen keyboard is a little smaller than I would have liked
 Connect it to your WiFi to pull down updates without having to use your cellular data as there are updates available for the phone

Worked with AT&T US without having to configure anything
 Uses a micro sim so you'll need to cut it yourself or get a cutter if you are currently using a standard size sim
Overall, a nice phone that you don't have to have a data plan for

I know Nokia build solid phones
 and the price is so good for the features
 So, I bought it from Breed store on Amazon
 The phone comes dead as brick
 It won't turn on
 It won't charge
 No response to any touch
 Happily , Amazon took the return
 I will order an replacement and update this review soon

Had a lot of good features, very good sound, signal strength, a solid phone, but after two try's of trying to getting one with English instructions I gave up
 How can they sell phones in the U
S
 of A
 with no English instructions

The description didn't say the phone would all be in Spanish
 The box & instructions were all in Spanish
 Took a whole lot if trial & error to change the setting to English

not so good
I recently bought this phone and it is beautiful, the camera takes clean pictures and stuff but i'm so disappointed because the phone is out dated and i've been trying to update it but so far no luck
 In the settings I required to open a nokia account and i've been trying to do so with no luck, it also does not support google play



Nice but not in english good delivery amazing service good job looking to purchase again
I just bought this phone
Can someone tell me how to activate it in English 
plz and thx

Great phone, do not miss it
Genial

Easy to use it, beautiful, cute and elegance is this phone, I love it, I am so exited with this phone, my mom is happy with her new toy

It has all the features as per the specifications except one thing: English is not an option

Good @ the price
 Recommended

excellent recommend
Very Good
excellent
Perfecto
The phone I received was not the one I saw on the ad
 That one has aa flash for the camera and the one I received does not have flash ability 
 not happy

Got mine and the battery was a serious issue
Try charging and still it was totally dead
 Crappy phone
 Dont buy it

I get very good comment on this Nokia phone

Dont come English subtitles , and turn off it self 

The phone is probably fine, but for some reason the box and instructions are in Spanish
 When my spouse gets home I will insert the sim card and see if it comes up in English or has an English setting
 Will post update when I know for sure
That is the only reason this item is getting 3 stars
 The phone was delivered on the day expected and seems to be a good little phone, but until I get the sim card in I won't know for sure

Excellent product and service, very satisfied

Love this phone
 Easy to use and great loud ringtones

It's very good

the phone came in an unsealed box
 i'm not sure if it was a refurb even though it was sold as new

This is a great phone even if you don't plan to do any traveling


the fact that it's unlocked alows you the freedom to do so

I purchased this cell phone supposedly new and because it had a warranty
 Right after my 30 day product warranty ran out


wouldn't you know it, the liquid screen went on my phone
 They told me ALL parts are covered under my warranty EXCEPT the liquid screen
 Of course
Very poor quality



The phone is awesome
 Very good reception
 Clear and loud speaker
 Highly recommended
 Don't hesitate order now

Good basic phone for my wife
 Needed nothing fancy as this delivered
Bought two of these and neither one will charge

Thank you

Love my pink phone
 We were looking for a new 2G phone because we are in trees and down in a little valley so we couldn't get a good signal with my old 3G phone
 We knew a Nokia 6085 that my husband has worked but couldn't find a "new" black one unless we paid $200
 This is what we found at a decent price and new at that
Shipped in a timely manner and came in perfect condition
 Seller contacted me by email to make sure I was happy
 I am

SENT TO A FRIEND AND I GUESS SHE LIKES IT

Good product at this price however it's outdated presently with so many new phones in market
this is a compact, easy to use phone that does what it is supposed to
 The sound quality is good, & it is attractive

Just like the phone that had died and which I liked so much
 I am so happy to have a duplicate of that phone

It works great my mom loves it 

 she said she couldn't work the speaker part 

 she love it
I got this phone for my mom who is super old fashion and not tech savvy at all
 This phone was so easy for her to function and no complaints so far from her :) Phone works great

I love the color to the phone its just your sims have to be unlocked
 But the phone came with everything you need to run the phone besides the sims
 It is an excellent product

I am disappointed this phone, the Nokia Pink flip phone has so many things locked
I had no idea that it would be any different than if I had gone down to At&T and bought, at least that's the impression you gave
 I would not buy another products of this kind or any other kind
 I believe that information was left out of you ad, that would have made a difference in my purchase
 I am 68 years old and feel that I was miss led

I don't like reviews that really don't rate the actual product, but I feel I must rate the contents of this phone's box 


 and the vendor UNLOCKED CELL PHONE KINGS INC
 The manual is a joke and is a Nokia generic black & white 8-pager
 I question that it is even by Nokia since I subsequently downloaded the real Nokia user manual for this phone from another site (114 pages compared to 8)
 And the battery is made in China and has no indication it is an OEM version
 Also, it was fully charged when it arrived
 THEREFORE, I presume I have been sold a used phone with a worthless, self-printed manual and a Chinese non-OEM battery
 I would not recommend buying from this vendor
 If I have problems with the phone, I'll report back

I ordered this to replace my mom's black 6085 that she had for a couple of years
 This is her favorite phone and I was so glad to find it on here and for such a great price
 I will be ordering another one to keep an extra for her on the chance her's dies again in another year or so
 It was new and in all original packaging
 Awesome deal

Estoy muy contenta con este telefono, es sencillo y práctico, sus funciones son muy agradables en la pantalla y es bastante liviano

Phone worked fine
 No problem, no trouble
 Tried it with several phone companies in Brazil
 Worked all right
 Nice phone
 A bit clunky, not super thin
I had one for 2 years and now bought this one
 I am hopeful it will last for a long time, too

I bought this to replace a Motorola Razr which was defective
 This phone is basic, easy to use, good size keys,good reception, and holds a charge for a few days
 It is made of plastic (and feels a bit flimsy), but for the price, it is a great phone
 It came with a wall charger, so the add-on in the Amazon posting to get the wall charger (which I did) was not necessary
 It did not come with a car charger

I must say I got this cell phone for my mother who's around her sixties and she hates advanced phones so she was looking for something simple
 So I got on Amazon searching for her favorite phone color which is Pink and found this phone that was ATT and unlocked
 Then I immediately showed her and she fell in love with it because it was something simple and basic she can use when she needs to keep in contact with all her family
 When the phone arrived it was a very nice phone and something anyone can figure out
 Over all I totally recommend this phone to anyone who doesn't like advanced touch screen phones or those smart phones, this phone is perfect for someone who just wants it for taking pictures and talking on the cell phone for constant communication

THIS IS THE 2nd ONE THAT I BOUGHT
 THE FIRST ONE LASTED OVER 2 YEARS AND WOULD HAVE LASTED LONGER IF I HADN'T DROPPED IT ON THE PAVEMENT AT WORK 100 OR MORE TIMES
 I'VE HAD 3 OTHERS SINCE & CAME BACK TO THIS 1, ONCE I FOUND IT ON AMAZON

 MUCH CHEAPER THAN THE FIRST 1 I GOT FROM MY CARRIER


Both are bad news
 I am out the expense and stuck with a defective phone; the seller won't honor the warranty and blames the problem on, "You must have dropped the phone and caused the defect
" The camera never worked right from the start and everyday it got worse, pixelating and soon, getting stuck in camera so that I had to remove the battery to unstick it
 STAY AWAY


My mother in law is using this model phone for the last 5 years, and is still working
 Bought this new one again as the old one worked so good, and she loved this phone very much

I ordered a pink phone and got a black one instead
 The black phone would not power up
 I immediately returned the item several weeks ago and have still not gotten credit for the return
 The worst rating available is 1 star but if possible I would rate this 00000 stars because absolutely NOTHING was done correctly

display went out, phone is not that old , junk, dont buy this phone you will not like it when it stops working
The phone is junk
 Looks like the original but isn't
 Doesn't have most of the features the original phone had
 Just the case is the same

Although this phone is "refurbished", it's just like new in every way
 I love it
 Planning to get one for my boyfriend, too

it was gift for my lady and she loves her cell- this is the second similar one i have got her
I have had a number of the Nokia 6085 phones
 They are small, hold charge well and are reasonably durable
 If you don't want a smart phone this is a good choice, and many are available at a good price
 Unfortunately, this one came with a small piece missing at the charger port

Just bought this for a little fun
 Colour ok, the finish isn't very strong
 After a few days of use a chip appeared in the casing
 This was a little disappointing, but aside from this one cosmetic fault, I enjoy this phone
 I can take photo, they may not be top quality, but I'm not complaining
 What can you expect for the prize
 Overall it functions great, I use it alot and it's never given me any trouble to date
 For anyone just needing a basic phone, I would highly recommed this one

I had this phone before but unfortunately it did not make it through the wash
 It is a basic phone with large numbers that are easy to use
 Nothing fancy, but my favorite

Phone arrived with incorrect battery
 Impressed with customer service, they called me and are sending a new, replacement battery immediately
 Phone works great, just as my husband wanted
 Easy to use, easy to find , love the phone
 Customer service is awesome

used poor condition and had contact info on it I had to delete
I can't keep it charged, almost daily needs juice, but works fine when charged

My dad loves it

not good
EXCELENTE


I purchased for my dad who is NOT tech savy
 AKA a technotard
 Within 3 weeks it died
 I'm furious that the product was such a lemon
Do not BUY THESE YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME & MONEY
if I could give it a -10 I would
This is an excellent product at an great price
 I would definitely purchase again

Excelent
excelente
My wife loves these phones
 This is the third one for her
 I think it is old tech, but if that is what makes her happy, then I will keep buying them as long as I can

Nice and good, i purchased it for my Dad
Really small and compact
 Sound great
 Transferred my sim card with out any problems
 ATT sim card
 Will be trying in Europe soon
 To text you have to be patient, because it's old school key pad
 But otherwise I like it

Go ahead, keep walking around with your large iPhones and becoming ever more dependent on that device
 I've had a Nokia 6350 for almost a decade
 When the charger post began to malfunction, I discovered that it was still available on Amazon
 A sturdy, well-designed little phone with picture, texting, and email capabilities
 I added extra memory, and it's a very convenient and simple piece of technology that keeps me connected without the need to get obsessive about it
 I only wish the pictures had more pixels; but, over the years, I've taken some great shots with it
 If only they could've re-designed the charging post
 After several years of pulling out the charger, the connection could fail again
 But, hey, none of the high-priced and over-sized iPhones are perfect either
 If you find one of these classics, buy it

Great purchase and smooth transaction
 Recommend purchase of this phone for the older generation that do not want a smartphone

I had this same phone for over 4 years and since I had dropped it a few times, the back cover would no longer stay on tight
 I saw this one while searching for a new phone
 I decided to purchase it and it is as much of a phone as I need
 I like it, it serves it purpose

works good
returned it
Ok
Excelent 



 Thanks
The phone is very good more than i expected
 it has a memory card slot, portable and light

Very nice little phone
 I purchased this for an elderly relative
 I added a louder ringtone which you can hear down the block
 This takes a full size SIM


 make sure you don't order a micro or mini-SIM
 The battery charge will last 3-4 days with light use
 The display, while dated, is more that adequate
 I downloaded Nokia desktop software which allowed me to load up numbers very quickly
 The keypad is very well designed and easy to use
 Reception on this phone is superb and conversations are exceptionally clear - better than my iPhone 6
 All-in-all this is a great back-up phone or perfect for folks that don't need or want a smartphone

phone works ok but the battery is no good shows full charge until no charge
I returned, because did not work
Best of the non smart phones
hard to use
Great replacement phone for my 'drowned' Nokia 6126
 Just transferred the SIM card and the micro SD memory card and it works perfectly
 Sadly, the batteries are just enough different that I can't use the old one as a spare, but



Works Great
My Client is very happy with this product

works for me, i don't need a phone that stands up and tap dances decent sound, once you get past the learning curve it is pretty easy
Good product, I read it in the description
 very practical and comfortable, with simple system and a very nice color
Good phone for the price
 Unlocked and had no problem by the time I was leaving Africa
 Until now, user has not complained to me 

Excellent phone for a gift, honestly this product meets all the desired expectations
 Surely the person who regale him he was very pleased

i bought this phone to be used in India and it worked like a charm
 Just inserted the regular sim and it was running
It does what it should







whats not to like
 Handy
 Good visual screen
 Simple to use
 Sounds good with simple controls

Have had problems with it
 Shuts off completely at random times, even while on the phone, won't turn back on

came with wrong battery
I was very much satisfied with the product
this is the only phone that will pick up in my rural area
 i will stay with the flip to have service

Battery drains in a day or two and the phone goes dead without warning, even unused
 Problem continued even after the battery was replaced

works like it is supposed to

Very Good

My wife loves this flip phone

it is very nice
phone works great
 Simple

but larded up with crappy AT&T bloatware that can't be erased

nunca sirvio
 It never worked
The phone looks well built and feels sturdy
 The applications and user settings are geared for an AT&T network connection
 I'm using TMobile and although the voice and texting features worked fine, many of the extras and configuration settings we not usable
The biggest problem with this phone is its battery charge longevity
 It lost its charge after 2 days, and I only had it on from 7AM - 7PM
 That was unacceptable to me and I returned it due to the battery issue

verry good
I purchase this phone and even replaced battery and less than a year later it will not even come on
Bad investment
Will never purchase this phone again
Bought this for my mom for her birthday
 She wanted a phone that was easy to answer and easy to hang up calls that didn't have an unlock code
 Also one that wouldn't dial someone if it was unlocked and in her purse
 Great phone
 Prompt delivery
 Looked just like the picture


love this phone no apps no bs just solid dependable features
GOOD, VERY GOOD:
I have doubts it's a new phone
 The charger is Sony Ericsson which is really strange
I will see if I keep it or return it
 I dont like when someone cheats in this cheap way

I like the Nokia 6350 3G phone
 It was a seamless transition from the phone that I had
 SIM card replacement was a snap

phone is good, battery doesn't last
We ordered this to replace the one we had on contract with our cellphone company
 Great price
I recommend it to anyone who doesn't use a smart phone
 I had one before and loved it
 It works great and does everything I need

I initially had difficulty charging battery and getting phone to work
 I had ordered another, spare, battery and that worked a little better
 Through Amazon, I contacted supplier and asked for a replacement battery since original couldn't be charged, Supplier sent a new phone, AC charger and battery
 Amazing

 It all works well now
 However, I still like many of the features of my very old quad-band Motorola RAZR V3 (address book is better organized, changing ring to vibrate, silent, etc is easier 


) more than the Nokia 6350
 What's better about the Nokia is it's "3G" and can work with our AT&T micro-cell tower at home which vastly improves home reception
 I had no trouble simply switching the SIM card from my old phone to the new phone

This phone might have everything you need and one might get used to it after a while but it's definitly not very easy to use
 For example, the simplest of things like checking your messages, checking who's called, changing ring tones, texting numbers, writing a text, etc
 are burried under layers and layers of menu options
There is, however, a programable "go to" button on the homepage where you can file all the functions you want in one place so that may be what Nokia has in mind for users access

It is wonderful works good I LOVE it
 it is a very good product and I Will shop again here

The Nokia 6350 is a good phone for individuals who do not want a smart phone
 It is a flip-phone that fits into a shirt pocket
 It provides good voice quality
 It has an easy-to-use menu to navigate to set up the phone
 It does provide access to the internet, if an individual wants or needs connection
 The screen, however, is small for internet use, but it allows connection for email through various providers

This is a simple and good mobile phone
 It works like it should work
 No fancy features, practical and easy
This phone does what I wanted it to do
 Although you can use it to take pictures, listen to music, and check your email, it's main purpose is to make and receive telephone calls
 In that respect it works fine
 I had an earlier version of this phone for many years and decided to replace it only because the battery was nearing the end of its life
 (A new phone was cheaper than a new battery
) Because it is unlocked, it also works in Europe with a European SIM card
 It comes with a GPS but you have to subscribe to a GPS service for this

I bought this phone to replace my old Nokia phone
 I have had problems with it cutting out while I'm talking to my mom but I'll keep it to use when my other dies

I could not use the phone enough to test all of its features
 Every time I went to use the phone after 24 hours itneeded to be recharged
 Other customers had complained about the same problem, only that I did not see that they to had only a 24 hour limit

So good if was human I'd marry it muwhahaha
 Okay but seriously I love this thing, I bought this to replace a ( Nokia C3 touch and Type ) which has unbelievably tiny keys This one however is for me the phone of my dreams it is very easy to use and for it's compact size is loaded with tons of functionsMeasurementsLength 7 inches
 Width 2 inches
 Depth//thickness about 1 inchFeatures and functions1-Micro USB Charging Connection
 2-Internet
 3-YP Mobile

 11-Messaging
 12-Smart Chip Applications
 13-Camera wiht zoom in and out, 14-GPS
15-Camera is immediately acessable thanks to the button on the keypad, you don;t have to go to the menu before you can acess it
 like some phones require
 It takes photos, and records like a camcorder, this includes self timer, image sequence, brightness control, effects, whitness balance, and video share call16-There is a screen on the outside so you can see who is calling without opening the phoneAppearance1-Menu functions are easy to see
 2- Colors are attractive and easy on the eyes
 3- The brightness is great
 4-Picture resolution, color, and clarity are amazing
5-Photographs look amazing very clear, perfect color balance, sharp clear details, no bluring or distortions6-Dialing numbers in a low light situation is made easy to deal with thanks to the great backlghting of the key board which is bright
 Unlike a phone I had in the past with yellow backlighting that causes eye strain this has white light like a lamp making it easy to see
SIM cardTransfering my SIM card was a snap, so you know on this phone the SIM card slides into a slot with the little gold part facing up instead of down, and is located below where the battery goes
 There is a seperate slot opposite the battery for a memory cardSoundExcellent very clear, no static or distortions
 hearing people talking is easy, volume control is great and easy to adjust thanks to the volume up down key on the left side of the phone
 Reception is very good, there are also a nice selection of ring tones to choose from
 You can also turn on or off the key beeps which I love hearing beeps with each key pressed drives me nuts
Good phone
it's easy to use phone


USER FRIEnDLY
I Like this phone better than my Smart Phone

phone works great, just wish there was a way to disable the PTT button on the side as it is easy to push when getting the phone out of a case

Excellent replacement for "dead" cell phone

Great Quality flip phone
excelente
Perfect
 Just what we needed
 Replacing a Nokia we had for 6 years
 My daughter loves this simple yet durable phone
 Thank you

This phone is great if you are only concerned with the following: Making and receiving phone calls (5 stars) Voice dialing (3 stars) Contact ring tones (4 stars - limited to 9sec per ring tone) Large text font (3 stars - could be a little larger) Notifications (4 stars) Camera (3 stars) Video (haven't used yet) Music player (4 stars - but with limited memory you don't want to get carried away)My problem was the fact that I am using this AT&T unlocked phone on Tmobile's network which caused problems when I tried to send or receive audio and picture messages
 So if you are not going to use AT&T with this phone you will not be able to send or receive picture and audio messages, otherwise everything else will work fine

It's a basic phone
 Good
GREAT to be able to buy a low cost phone without a 2 year obligation





























 Take that, cell phone company

I bought this flip cell phone for my wife she loves-it
She like flip phones specially with brite collors like this one
We purchased because (1) unlocked, (2) used SIM card, (3) "3G" so we could use our AT&T microcell tower as our home reception is terrible
 Works much better than very old Moto RAZR V3 which were not "3G"
 Ring tones on phone were terrible
 I deleted all that I could & then downloaded (for FREE) several ring tones I liked at [


]
 We purchased two, thous one and a grey one
 Both are excellent

The phone had out dated software
 I still liked the phone but had no use for it
 As well, i returned it
 The company was cooperative with me

I bought this phone as the description said it is unlocked
 When I on the phone after placing my sim, I was asked to enter a pin to unlock the device
 This is falsely advertised
 Do not buy this phone

This phone meets the requirements I expected
 The flip design and the outside screen continues to be very modern and practical

Falsely advertised
 Phone was restricted
 Could not get a restriction code from my carrier, because it has an AT&T logo, locked by AT&T
 No code from AT&T because I was not their customer
 No help from Nokia, needed carrier to request the code from Nokia
 Returned phone without ever getting it to work

The phone is fairly easy to use
 Bought it for a lycamobile account I opened for my grandfather
 It was easy to set up the speed dial that he likes to use and he really enjoys the phone
 The only issue is that the volume on this phone is definitely not loud enough
 Also it's too easily to accidentally open up something that will use data

The Nokia 6350 arrived on time and securely packaged
 It is everything that is stated in the profile and I really like having this phone
 I added a 16GB micro SD card to store music on

My husband likes his Nokia Cell, however something is wrong with the battery and its off by itself every five to ten second and its hard to figure it out what's happening because no manual booklet came with the phone
 On top of that we love the cell phone

My SIM card was defective, though it worked in other phone
 They advised me to obtain a new SIM card from the same provider (red pocket), which I did, and really everything worked the best

I received a new cellphone in excellent conditiond but after sometime cellphone has presented some problems to receive calls and messages
Does what I want it to do, it is a replacement or backup phone since my other 6350 does not charge the battery anymore
 A defective phone receptacle
 Happy with the 6350 because I don't text and do all this teenager stuff

I bought this phone for my mother - when I got it to her it never worked - turns out it was burnt out to start and the cost of fixing it was more than the cost of the phone to begin with
 Was unable to return it but will never buy this or other phones here again
This is good product, I'm happy to have a phone that meets my simple communication needs, is comfortable in my hand and easy to use

not my favorite real low volume and very fragile, hard to hear people
 Nice looking package poor cell phone
 sorry I bought it
for just your basic phone, you can't get better for the price
Texting in fine and can check email
The camera , not bad for 2mp

Very easy use phone without data plan, good quality from nokia
 too bad Nokia didn't continue develop better smart phone

Happy with the phone
 My husband has one just like it
 Good size,clear reception,keyboard visible, good values


I would recommend this phone
Received the phone on time
 I have shopped Amazon and I trust their products and if it is not right you can send it back postage paid

Brand new phone and funcions great strong signal, pleanty of features for a flip phone and it is my favorite color

could not get this to work even though we were replacing the EXACT same phone
 Every AT&T store we went to told us that we had been sold a pre-used phone and that they could not activate it

ordered red received black
This item is ok it is a present that was sent to some one out in the west indies they have not said any thing about it so I am assuming that it is ok and working well

Males phone calls on ATT 3 G network
It is a nice and easy phone
 The only problem with it -- at least with the one I've got -- is the battery, you need to re-charge it every day

Perfect phone for an older relative that does not like Smartphones and still wants the convience of an older flip phone
 Eaasy to install SIM card, and voice calls are crisp and clear
 Would recommend

got this for my dad, he wanted a basic phone but w/ good features
 he loves it and very happy with the product

Did not have a sim card
 would not send tx
 wast of money

worked out great

good

This is a replacement phone
 The display on the front (shown here) went out on my original phone
 The pricing on this was reasonable
 My husband also has the same phone
 The only minor problem is the battery
 We usually get about 3 days of battery life with the phone on with not much use
 Easy to read
 We do very little texting and do not have a data plan but it does has a camera and is very good

Good deal
It is alright
 I guess that it didn`t last long because my mom dropped it several times
Didn't keep information as it should have
 Found numbers gone etc

Battery need charging often
ok
I purchased this phone because I have one just like it and I like the features of my flip phone that I have been using for years and don't want to learn about all the new phones
 I just want a simple phone for calls and texts and pictures
 the phone itself is great, however I purchased one of these and set it aside because I didn't know how to transfer my stuff from my old phone and I figured I would get help eventually
 My old phone had been dropped so many times I had to tape it together to keep the battery in
 I finally stopped in at Best Buy to have them help me transfer my stuff from my old phone to my new phone
 This could not be done because this phone I purchased and sat on for several months was LOCKED and because I waited, I could not return

Junk
 The phone doesn't work overseas
 It was a waste of $60
 It also fell apart within the first week of use
 Do not buy

was locked to at&t
My phone arrived quickly and in perfect condition
 It works very well
 All I want is a good cell phone to talk with and this fits my needs perfectly

phone didn't work had to return
It's a great flip phone
 It's small, easy to use and stylish

Good
Problem with dropping calls

great little pnone still in service
Great Phone, Just add SIM card and work like a Charm

The phone is okay
 I have used the same kind of phone for the last 6 years
 The problem is with the charger they sent to charge the phone
 It was not for this phone and it was broken

phone was perfect for mother-in- law, who we added to our plan
 But she did not want smart phone

Nokia phones are the best
 If you are looking for a simple and reliable cell phone without the complexity of a smart phone, I highly recommend this Nokia flip phone

OK

I received this phone quickly, which was awesome
 I am very pleased with this phone
 I actually ordered it for my Mom
 She had this phone for quite some time before and the screen on her old phone just went blank
 She is up in age and I wanted to get her the same phone so she wouldn't have to try to learn a whole new style phone
 I just inserted her SIM card from her old phone and that was it
 I am so glad I found this one for her
 She tells me how happy she is that it's just like her old one
 So far no problems with the new phone
 Thank you

While the features look great on paper, the usability of this phone is awful
The good:Easy to put together
Charger works great
Inserted my existing sim card and we're up and running, no problems
Makes phone calls when you dial
The bad:Usability usability usability
Menus are SLOW
 Click an option and it seems like it didn't work
 But if you click again, oops you went too far


Waaaaaay too many useless apps pre installed and they can't be removed
 If you don't have a data plan, 80% of the features on this phone are inaccessible
 All the apps seem to be from AT&T
The PPT button
 Way too easy to press, then you have to wait for it to tell you there's no data service (if no dataplan)
The volume button is way too low, you have to hold your phone halfway too low to use it with your thumb
Would be great if they moved the PPT button and slid the volume up
You can't hold the phone in your right hand while charging
 The cable sticks out the side making it very difficult to hold
My phone seems to have a problem with turning off randomly for no apparent reason
 I don't know if its just mine or a common issue
 It appears to be truly random
 Lately it seems to not even want to turn back on, or it turns on and vibrates but immediately turns back off (It's fully charged)
You have to hold the power on button far too long just to turn it on
The menus are just too annoying to use
 Menu, My Stuff, Tools, just to get to common basic applications like the alarm or calculator
So sloooooooow switching menus
Sim card holder is a bit wonky but not too difficult to get used to if you don't use it often
I've always liked nokia phones but this one is going back

Phone is pretty BUT i dont know how to work it because it didnt come with a manual or booklet of anykind




everything appeared to have been fondeled not used but definately handeled
 I took my sim card out of my phone but the Nokia said no sim card




went to my provider and actually had to get a new sim card





now if i only knew how to work it



i will google and figure it out




i will update if necessary
 The item came as stated

This phone was purchased for my father who had not changed phones in ten years
 After purchasing the phone it was fairly easily to explain the features on the phone and for him to use the phone

AT&T now has a very poor selection of basic phones
 All are larger, thicker, and have less features than my old Nokia 6350 purchased almost 4 years ago
 I was fortunate to find this new Nokia 6350 when the ringer on my old phone stopped working
 My primary complaint is not with the phone itself but with the loaded AT&T software geared at data usage and extra purchases
 The phone has one month "free trials" that you must opt out of in order not to charged an ongoing monthly fee
 For example I do not need to pay $1
95/mo to display the city matching the area code of an incoming call

it is hard to charge, It does not recognize the charger which is a generic travel charger not the original
 it came only with this charger, no papers, no booklet no headphones
 it is a defective refurbished phone
 I am waiting for the sellers to answer my claim

This phone is the second one I have bought of this type
 The first one started turning off on a whim early on, even in the middle of calls
 I returned it and replaced it with another one
 This one worked for about four months then the same thing started happening 
 This morning it turned off while I was trying to answer a call from a prospective employer


Very good
The phone worked okay (never great) for a little while
Using the camera more often than not required restarting the phone (otherwise it would say "Not Allowed")
Text messages took as much as 20 minutes to be able to access after restarting the phone
Loading up the menu took around 10-20 seconds
All of these were frustrations I begrudgingly put up with
 But not even 4 months into owning it, I plugged it in to charge one night


and in the morning, the phone was off (it was on when I plugged it in)
 I could not get it to turn back on
An absolute waste of money
 DO NOT buy this phone

The phone simply does not work well, speaking ONLY of basic telephone use and not at all of all of the goodies the phone allegedly has
 It's as if it is still tied up in the ATT system so that one cannot really use certain basic features, such as accessing my address book without having a warning sign come up and block the list, saying that I'm not properly signed on to the network 

Ok phone
 Already dropped once and it still works
 Camera is ok but would like to see higher mg rating
I got this for my grandmother who is turning 78 in December
 She wanted a new basic phone for a long time, one with a camera and bigger buttons
 This is a huge upgrade from her Sony Ericsson w300i which had broke that morning that i gave it to her
 Came right on time
 she loves it so much

It said unlocked but the phone was for att and couldn't use it with tmobile
 i had to return it

The battery life was lower than expected
 The red case chipped very easily especially at the side near the buttons
 Call quality is reasonable
 However the AT&T software isn't very efficient
 There is a moment of pause after hitting the menu button for it to get to the menu
 Also, there's no easy way to access voicemails
 Thus I ordered and received a Nokia 106 to replace this phone
 It hasn't even been a day but I am liking it better already

Nokia is still great even today
 If you like the loud and clear sound quality, this phone is for you
 Plus it works in Japan and Korea, where the frequencies are unique

As far as non smart phones go this one was pretty neat, good ringtones and what not
 I believe you can add a memory card and download and play music
 My mom doesn't know how to do that so its perfect for her
 Be careful when putting the back on, she bent one of the little plastic prongs and now it doesn't close all the way

I needed another spare phone for emergencies
 This phone fills that role and meets my cost guidelines
 It is an excellent phone

I have had this phone for 6 months and it no longer recognizes the charger that came with it
 A couple of weeks ago, I contacted the seller about the battery since it would not hold a charge more than a day, and if I talked on it, only a few hours, but they said that there was nothing they could do about as I`d had it too long
 I totally wasted my money on this
 Very disappointing

Good product, I read it in the description
 very practical and comfortable, with simple system and a very nice color
The flip phone nokia 6350 Fades in and out , doesn't receive or transmit well
 Probably wouldn't buy it again

I got this as a gift for my mom
 It was a little challenged to get the sim card in at first but after the sim was inserted it worked perfectly
 She loves her phone and states that the fact that it flips open is a plus

Was for a friend
 She loves it

made my mom happy with this phone its so easy for her to use
Very good product
Good
excellent
Phone did not perform as expected after a short time
 Screen went "white"
 A call to local A T & T phone center informed me most likely phone could not be repaired and should be returned to vendor
Waiting for credit
 Thank you

Not the phones fault


my daughter went to Dominican Republic and couldn't figure out what sim to buy or how to use it
 Definitely NOT compatible with Consumer Cellular
 I first bought it for my mother to use with their sim



Thanks


Needed a non-smart phone to replace my mother's old phone
 Couldn't get anything out there through AT&T at the time so I went for this one instead
 Loud enough speaker but the back faceplate kept falling off every time she picked up her phone
 She ended up losing the phone after 1 month use and no way to find it
 Shipping was quick but the box was old looking

I purchased this basic phone for my mom who is very technically challenged
 It was perfect



 except this particular phone would not charge
 At first it charged with no problem
 I took it to the phone carrier to obtain service and was ok the first day
 It sat "idle" for a couple of days (no one used it) and it never would charge again
 Unfortunately, I had to return this phone which is a shame because this phone is a lot like the Jitterbug my mom had
 But Jitterbug phones do not have SIM cards so you have to use their service
 I wanted to change her to a less expensive plan which is why I bought this phone
 I opted to not get a replacement because I was able to get a special deal with my phone carrier to add my mom to my plan and get a phone to boot
 Otherwise, the service, shipping, packaging, and design of the phone was excellent

Let me explain, I can make calls and recieve calls but the internet, gps and other functions do not work with a TMOBILE sim card

got it for my mother, who is not a fun of smart phone and finds it too complicated to use
 She loves it and very easy for aged people to use
The wife wanted a better phone for texting and talk and preferably red
 This fit the bill and she's very happy
Works great with Platinumtel
 The camera is even pretty good

I like the big buttons for my large hands


 Easy to use, just wish there were a few more ring tones to choose from
I purchased this flip phone for my husband who refuses to use a smart phone
 I recently switched from Verizon to T-Mobile, so I needed to purchase new phones
 Based on reviews, this appeared to be a good phone
 Received the phone on December 27 and placed the T-Mobile sim card into it
 The phone powered up and displayed the T-Mobile information
 The phone and text services work fine
Be aware, this is an ATT branded phone
 Although the phone is unlocked, it comes with the ATT software
 Most of the functions, like GPS, Mobile Web, YP Mobile, MEdia Mall, and ATT Social Net don't work
 As the husband only wanted phone call functionality, this is not an issue
 There maybe a way to add T-Mobile software to the phone, but I haven't figured that out yet

I bought it for my mom as a Christmas gift, when we open this phone it require registration number that's mean the phone is not unlocked
 I call Amazon they said i need to call manufacturer to get unlocked number and they gave me a oversees phone number(Nokia manufacturer in Finland) to get unlock number, I waste my money and time, I wants my money back
 everyone Careful, when u buy from Amazon
This is by far the best flip phone out there
 Used with the free Nokia PC connect software this phone has amazing functionality

All we had to do is switch the sim card from the old phone and all information went over to the new phone
 We have AT&T and the old phone was the identical model

Everything
 Is great
 Working
 Good no problem good service good connection I recommended others
 To use this
 Phone high quality
Just like it was described
 Since there is no user guide & there are some new functions, it's a little inconvenient to look online to see how to use them

I don't like it, don't charge very well

It's something wrong with the battery 


Used this phone for many years until the cell service changed here and I got a new phone

Brand new pnhone
 Works well
 Delivered pretty good too

This item is exactly as described 
 It is even better than I thought it might be
 Thanks for paying attention to your business

I ordered the Nokia 6350 flip phone refurbished from Amazon in October 2015
 I hated damn phone cuz it overheated, it went dead fast, I could barely hear people when I was talkin on the phone which pissed me off
 I also had bought another phone from Amazon on January 1 2014 and the phone was defective and didn't work
 I will never order a phone from Amazon again cuz it pissed off dat the phones don't work and I had to mail my phones back which is a inconvenience

Worked like a month as a pro, do all the stuff, and then shut down and didn't turn on, a little disappointed on nokias people and the seller but i cant ask for heaven on a 50$ phone
this is NOT unlocked
 Dont fall for the lie
 But if you plan to use it only as an AT&T customer, go ahead
When I got this phone, I saw some bad reviews, but then I thought it's a Nokia phone and I just ignored them
Also, I don't like to write bad reviews, but I want to do this now, so that people know not to buy this phone
 This is definitely not Nokia quality
 I used to have a couple older Nokia flip phones and they were better
 Starting with the organized feel, splash screen, the way contacts are grouped and topping with the batter life which is just lousy, this phone just doesn't feel like a Nokia phone

This Unit does not match-up with the specs for it
 The Talk and Stand-by time is approx 1/4 of what it should be
 The Seller was nice enough to sent me a fresher battery; it did not iimprove sufficiently to make a big difference
 The phone itself is a nice unit

Excellent and perfect
The Nokia 6350 itself is fine, but I needed an unlocked phone This phone from this supplier was not unlocked
 I've purchased two other unlocked phones on Amazon and had have no problems using them on my network with my SIM card
I can't remember the exact wording of the message displayed, but I looked on the Internet and found the message meant the phone was still locked
 I also found that unlock codes are offered online for about $20 with the disclaimer that the codes are not guaranteed to work
 I decided to return the phone

Had another brand with a touch screen that didn't work well
 If you touched the phone, not even the screen, it would disconnect the incoming call
 Couldn't carry it in my pocket
 Slightest movement would make the phone do who knows what even with the touchscreen locked
 Gave up on touchscreens after the manufacturer of that phone replace the original and still had the same problem
 Had to discontinue my unlimited data plan because the carrier (AT&T) didn't care about the problem with the new phone
 I had it over 30 days and that was enough for them 
 This is an unlocked world phone
 That means I can use it with any carrier anywhere in the world
 When my contract with AT&T (yes, they gave me the other phone for a penny when I signed a two year contract, phone doesn't provide what I paid for but the contract is still in effect), I can use this same phone when I switch carriers
 The only thing I don't like on this phone is the inability to delete unused icons from the menu screen, or to put icon shortcuts on the screen that you do use
 Have to open an icon (My Stuff) then scroll to a menu item (Tools) then scroll to Recent Calls to see who called you when you were unavailable
 Would be nice to have that menu item as an icon on the main screen
 RECEPTION IS GREAT
 Have to emphasize that feature
 I'm in a rural 3G area (4G coming soon, or so they say) and the other phone from AT&T had two, one or no bars of service
 This phone has either four or five all the time
 Never dropped a call like it did all the time with the Pantech Renue from AT&T

Bought this to replace an older one, which was the same model and color
 Older one was beat-up sfter ~4 years of use (and abuse)

Phone works great and was instantly activated with no problem at the AT&T store
 Has capacity for two SIM cards if you are a international traveler
Only issues is that the phone lacks an attachment point for a leash, a major pain for anyone keeping it in a purse or bag and the second display has few personalization options
Good functional phone at a great price for anyone who does not want or need a smart phone AND no 2 yr contract

Only three stars due to lack of leash

I wasn't able to use the phone due to fact I opted to stay with my current cell-phone

carrier

At&t would not transfer my old number
or the minutes


 all a matter of staying with my current carrier


There is nothing bad to say about this phone
 The delivery arrived before it was due
 The phone was in new condition just as it said in the ad

The phone is nice, but didn't come with the instruction book plus bought it new

 Ring tone isn't very loud


Had this phone before and really liked it
 Was glad to get another
 The used phone I received is clean and almost like new

This phone has all features that I need; it fits in my pocket with its small size - works great and so was the price

Yes, I hate changes
 I love my flip phone
 My old one was held together with scotch tape and worked like a charm but, hey it had to be replaced
 It took a lot of beatings and kept right on working until I got me a new one
 Just like the old Time Ex watches takes a beating and keeps on ticking
 Something like that

This phone is worse than a lemon
 Its a Walmart-sized tangerine
 Stopped working after a few days
 It takes forever to charge
 After 10 hours of keeping on charge, it wouldn't have enough charge to switch on fully, let alone function
 It would take a full day to charge and then drain in a day
 I was traveling and too busy to return it within the specified time period
 Had to buy another phone
Nokia is supposed to have good phones that keep their charge for a long time
 I have always used Nokia, But never this model
 and never again
 Not sure if it was the phone or the seller selling these tangerines
 Checked the charger and the battery - both seemed to be fine so it must be something badly made inside the phone

verry happy with this phone even if was not for me ,the person that recive it as a gift was verry happy and thank me a lot

I was very disappointed when I open the pack, no cover, no battery, and was locked for ATT, for what I paid it was a lost, I had to purchase another one at the storeVery disappointedSorry, never again
I gave this to my son and he loves it
 It has all the features he wanted and it was a good price

I wanted a flip phone after having problems with other touch screen types of cell phones
 Its a good phone but texting is hard since your using a 10 key phone pad
 Battery life is not great

Hello just fine product it is not all the languages ​​I have in Hebrew and there is why I was disappointed
Only complain is that the phone had no instruction booklet with it 
 Or any other paperwork or proof of purchase

I love this phone
 It looks good, and is very easy to use
 If all you need is a cell phone for making and receiving calls, and maybe a little bit of texting this is the perfect phone
 I talked my wife into buying one as well
 She had one of those do everything phones which she never used
 Just like me she had a hard time using the touch screen, this phone is perfect
 I can even open and close it with one hand

Great phone and my daughter loves it
 We would buy it again if she lost the one she now has
 The first two sentences are enough and no more need be said
This cell phone doesn't work right now, only two days no power at all
 I don't what happen
 What should I do now
My first cell phone was a Nokia
 It was wonderful
 But I dropped it several times
 It was my own faults
This Nokia model doesn't live up to Nokia standards
To accept incoming calls, I have to push 3 bottons
After I make a phone call, I cannot make another call immediately
 I have to wait until it is ready again
 It doesn't take long
 But it is a nuisance
DON'T buy this Nokia model

The anounce says new



 but the original box is opened
Also there is no provided the headphone
 I will test if works in Peru
I love this phone, this is my second nokia flip phone
 This exact phone lasted for 3 years, I rarely ever lose service and I don't have to worry about dialing people by accident
 I don't even have to charge the phone everyday

Nice phone very easy and simple to use
 This is my second one
 Will probably get another in 2 years if still available

I used my first Nokia 6250 for almost five years
 My husband and I looked at the new iPhone but I could barely read the fine print on the small screen
 I do not eMail, text, surf the internet or listen to music on a phone so do not want a data plan, just a simple phone that can hold my address book
My husband was in an ICU when the my first Nokia 6250 finally had to be replaced
 I put the sim card into my husband's Blackberri and used it for a frustrating six weeks: The tiny keys were difficult for my arthritic fingers to use, it was not nearly as comfortable to hold as the Nokia, and I'd never use most of it's features
 I finally gave up on it and found this phone on Amazon
I'm again happy to have a phone that meets my simple communication needs, is comfortable in my hand and easy to use
 I then purchased a mini iPad with a data plan
 It is SO much easier to read and use than the "smart phones, and it easily slips into my purse
 For me, this is the best of both worlds

The handset speaker did not work out of the box
 I contacted the seller and explained the symptoms and we both agreed it was a defective unit
 The seller immediately processed the return and made every attempt to correct the issue
 The phone has great features and is perfect for someone who doesn't want a smartphone
 Too bad it was defective



i tried for a week or more to activate the phone and finally a call to striaght talk engineers said that this phone could not be used on straifh talk so i had to return it

This phone does not work
 it won't connect and it loses its charge
 I am hoping they will replace it

The numbers and writing are way too small and the battery does not last very long 


 Not real satisfied with it 



Wife love it
It seems older people just want to make ph calls
 Text every now and then
 My husband said it's great and the pad #'s are larger than his old ph

Let me start by saying I hate smart phones
 This little phone does almost everything I want from a phone, tells time on the front little screen (until you have had one that made you open it to see the time you don't know what a convenience the front screen is) calendar, alarms, customizable main screen display, MP3 player, with some know-how and a micro SD card you can get your mp3s to play as ring tones, and great colour
 It worked immediately when I slipped my cricket SIM card in
 I WAS happy with this little phone, but like any phone there are a few little drawbacks; first I wish it had alerts for reminding me of missed calls, I had one that would beep ever 15min
 so I wouldn't forget to check my phone for missed calls if I didn't happen to hear the ring
 A big downfall is that the features aren't set up intuitively, it takes some getting used to finding simple things like changing your wall paper, finding the camera and ring tones in the menus
UPDATE: It is now a year later and this phone is dead
 I accidentally dropped it in the dog dish and it was done in
 Only in the water for less than 5 seconds, I pulled the battery, let everything dry and it appeared it was going to work, but then died two days later
 Small things about this phone began to irritate me, like there is no way to turn the ringer off that I could find, so it could not go to the theater or church with me
 The front display does not show the date, and takes so long to load the time that it is actually quicker to pull the phone completely out of my holder and flip open to see the time
 Also, any time it got dropped, even on carpet, the whole thing would fly apart, battery cover, battery and phone would all part ways

PHONE WAS RECEIVED WITHIN AN ACCEPTABLE TIME PERIOD
 WHEN MAKING CALLS I COULD HEAR THE PERSON I CALLED BUT THEY WERE UNABLE TO HEAR ME
 hAD PHONE CHECKED AT 2 SEPARATE SITES AND BOTH SITES FOUND THE PHONE DEFECTIVE
 RETURNING THE PHONE TO THE SUPPLIER




It is exactly what I wanted, not flimsy, great sound, holds a charge longer than any I have ever had
 I have had a series of "dumb phones" -- I do not want a smart phone, but this one isn't even dumb
 Smart choice
 fits great in my pocket
 You can't beat Nokia

Functionality is great
 Nokia probably my favorite phone manufacturer
 Only complaint on this one is short battery life
 Charging it every other day

We received the phone, followed instructions from removing the battery to inserting the SIM card went to charge it but it never turned on
will be returning it tomorrow

Bought this for my mother since she loves this style phone
 Arrived quickly
 Had an issue with incorrect charger being sent but that was remedied quickly
 Thank you
 Phone is working great and my mother loves it

I did not get what I expected in this phone
 There was no instruction manual
 It does not have a speaker phone as was adverised
 The ring tone is very soft even with at the maximum setting
 It is very difficult to manuver on this phone
 In addition, the reviews I read on this phone had the same problems as I mentioned
 I will no doubt return it
After many attempts I was not able to contact any one at Amazon in Las Vegas
 No one would ever answer the phone

We got one for my brother who's travel in Europe and this phone not make it 4 weeks froze up
buy little better name product pay by them self and save you madness
I gave this as a gift for Christmas
 It was enjoyed so much I ordered a second for him for a backup
 If you still enjoy a simple flip phone, this is the phone for you

I got the phone for my father who is 89 years old
 He received the phone, put in the SIM card and everything worked fine

I got this for my parents , my dad got my mom a smartphone and she is just not into it, she likes the regular no fuss kind, I found this on amazon and it was everything she needed, I really loved seeing her face when she got it and could actually make and receive calls
 I would recommend this for anyone who likes a simple phone, great look, great feel, very light, great clarity in sound, just a really nice phone



Phone is very nice, easy to use
 So far, I have only used it for phone calls
 I am not one who texts or uses any other media so can't speak for that

This is my first "flip"phone
 It is easy to use but I find it does not hold a charge as long as my old Nokia phone did
 Also the volume on the side of the phone is a little inconvenient as I am hard of hearing and sometimes I hit the button and the volume is lowered by mistake

It is a great cell phone
 It works as it should and has absolutely all the features
 I am very grateful
I like Nokia and chose this as a gift
 It's locked to AT&T
 I live in Trinidad so shipping back to Amazon was out of the question
 Amazon issued me a partial refund
 They try to keep the customer happy
 I would not recommend this seller for unlocked phones
 This rating does not judge the phone
 I cannot rate it since it is locked and I have been unable to use it

too much useless at&t stuff on it

 hard to navigate

 not all functiions worked

 returned it

 company and service is good , just not the phone

On my previous Nokia flip phone, I was used to seeing the battery gradually discharge and I knew when it was time to recharge
 With this one




battery symbol just goes red
 When I took off the back of the phone to remove the battery so that I could install my SIM card, it was a real chore to get the back to "click" in
 Other than that, a nice, little cellphone for the price
 Also, it was a "revelation" to me that my SIM did not contain my contacts
 Seems contact get saved to the phone, not the SIM card
 I fired up my old phone (no SIM card needed) and was able to see all my contacts

I am very disappointed about my purchase it clearly stated that this phone is unlocked and when I put in my sim card its asking for a code
 At this point I need to get a refund or another phone
 No one should buy from this company its very clear that they are very dishonest
 Very very angry at this moment

The phone was not unlocked
It made dad happy and that's not easy to do

I'm sure this has very little to do with the seller, just a bit
 My husband doesn't want to do the 'smartphone' thing and had always had an easy flip phone, so when he lost his he wanted one a lot like it
 The problem is even tho it works with TMobile, it's really made for AT&T and thus, you can't get all the AT&T specific stuff off the phone that only works with a AT&T plan
 SO, I know for sure I'd NEVER buy another phone like this, EVER
 It's either gotta be just for your carrier,and not a phone that a seller says works for AT&T and TMobile, tho, it's true it does work with TMobile, but only if You don't mind that everything on it, works specifically for the other company
 The back fell off, and it's just too much bother
 SO were throwing it away, as we both hate it, and am buying a phone from the company
 Something irritating, getting stuck in a screen that says AT&T Navigator, put in your 10 digit number and getting stuck there



The phone was unlocked, but that did not mean that I would be able to use the internet with this phone
 I could only call and receive calls on the phone
 This was because I have a T-Mobile account and this is an AT&T phone
 No one from either carrier could tell me how to change the settings to allow use of the internet with this "unlocked, Nokia 6350 flip phone"
 Not happy

This was a replacement for one dropped in water
 Works great with no issues
 Grate Phone

Nice phone but dropped calls from start
 These are older left overs as they look new
 Had a different model from China listed as New but had 2 phone numbers in a contact list - maybe someone else didn't like it either
So far my phone is not unlocked
 I am not able to use it
 Please tell me how to unlock my phone
 I paid for nothing
 I am so angry about this situation

The screen went bad shortly after we started using it

I BROUGHT THIS PHONE AS AN UNLOCK PHONE AND IT ISN'T
the surface is peeling and I haven't had for very long
 My old one that I had for years, never peeled

This replaced an identical five-year-old ATT flipper so switching over was easy
 This Nokia phone is a quality product, durable (except for the soft-touch coating that is easily chipped - a cosmetic issue that doesn't effect function)
 The phone is small, fits nicely in the pocket and has a camera that isn't too bad
 The $90 pricetag was a bit steep for just a basic phone but I wanted a proven product, just like my old one, in red

looks good
It's a great phone with all the essentials that I need & use
 I'm still getting used to all the functionality
 I haven't been able to change or download ringtones but it may be something I'm just not doing right
 Because I'm not sure about this problem I'll have to rate it 4 stars

I bought this phone for my mom last year and its been nothing but a pain
 She was having trouble with it receiving calls when she first got it and some other issues and sent it back to be repaired
 Well they "fixed" it only for her to get it back with the battery cover falling off
 Half the time it doesn't even work and today it just quit on her completely when my nephew tried to blow on the sim card
 It won't even turn on
 I bought my mom a Nokia because they are notorious for being unbreakable but apparently they didn't get the memo when they manufactured this piece of crap

IT TOOK TOO MUCH TIME TO ARRIVE USA
 AND BAD QUALITY ITEM, MAYBE WAS REFURBISHED ITEM

good phone

This was purchased for my Father, and it handles the vast majority of what he uses it for quite well - but he almost only uses it for traditional voice calls
 I was tasked with setting it all up, and I periodically check-in with him and see how the phone is working
 And after about 10 months the phone is still working (with AT&T prepaid) as expected
Pros:- Works well with AT&T prepaid, and seems to pickup a wireless signal decently
- the numbers on the buttons and the screen are fairly easy to see
 Not the biggest I have seen, but thankfully big enough for my Father
- Ringer can get fairly loud (with limitations)
- Charges fairly quickly
- My Dad says he likes the red color- The phone is sturdy (can take a fall)
Cons:- The written text/letters on the screen are fairly small
 If my Dad really stops and focuses he can read a text message, but you can only make the text so big
- The red portion on the front is soft and grippy - which is good for grip - but it scratches quite easily
- Charger that came with it is pretty flimsy and loses connection while charging a little easier than I would like
- Very limited ringtones available on the phone, and most seem to be a high frequency, which my Dad has trouble hearing
 So the only ringtone he can really hear is the rock-n-roll one, which he says he is fine with, but everyone remotely close to him can hear it blasting too
 Obviously, this is an issue with his hearing impairment, but it might be worth keeping in mind that even though the volume of the ringer can get loud, the ringtone may not be in a good frequency
Overall, he likes it
 It's more expensive than I would like it to be, but it has lasted about 10 months so far so that's alright I suppose
 So while the phone may be limited, if you're going to use it in a limited manner, it may be just right for you

I received the phone unlocked but had trouble inserting the SIM card
 The slot for the SIM card is under the battery
 You have to insert the Sim card in a way so that the golden part will remains outside
 The seller was kind enough to call and help me
 After following his instructions, the phone recognized my Sim card and everything is dandy
 It works well
 I bought the phone for my aunt, a Liberian old lady
 She loves it to death
 It works with any Sim card - it is unlocked
 She plans to take it to West Africa but for now, she is using it in Minnesota
 I recommend this phone to folks who are not interested in smart phone features
 It works well
 Mark my words

It does what we need it to do

I purchased this phone last year August and it is not working, it is not even a year as yet and I could not make a call, receive a call, all my contacts was gone, buttom line no service not even the at&t logo was not even showing, only a blank page or nothing, and then it was not coming on at all, the phone was dead
 Can you tell me why this happened

Nice phone, the camera is pretty decent too

not unlocked
bought for a friend, they loved it
It serves my purpose to a "T"
 Thanks
This phone allows the person to roam the internet but they cannot download anything from the internet
 I had brought this phone to download from the internet, apps, in order to talk with my fiance outside of America
 This phone doesn't allow anyone to do anything like that
 The phone doesn't come unlocked as well
 So, if anyone wants an unlocked phone, this is not the phone for you
 The phone looks new, and it has a great battery life
 Speaking about batteries, it doesn't come with one, nor does it come with a 'Sim' and 'memory card' for that matter
 The person has to buy those things before even using the product
 Other than that, it is a great phone

Ok
FILE MANY DETAILS OF OPERATION
Perfect
never worked this crap and I have sent back to cellular gallery but amazon fix my problem thanks
THANKS
Hope it will not be discontinued
Second one of these I have bought
 Both didn't last 2 months
 :(
Bought this phone for my mom to use and it has already quit working
 I just wanted to get her a simple phone to make and receive calls and it is so hard to find flip phones for the "older" generation to use


she had less than a month and it won't even turn on/stay on


apparently there is a loose connection somewhere internally


 Go figure



just when my dad has to go to a rehab facility after surgery

perfect timing

I bought this phone for my father in April
 The product appeared to arrive in good order
 However; after only 2 weeks of use the battery completely died and will not hold a charge any longer
 We have searched to see if we can buy a replacement battery to no avail
 I am not out 60
00 and have a phone that isn't usable and an expired expiration policy
 Is there anything that can be done to replace the phone at this point



 PLEASE HELP

Works for me
Love it 

Great Phone and excellent battery performance
This is not new as describe


more of refurbished
 Phone would automatically shutdown
 When you are on a call you can hear the other end but they can not hear you
 missing instruction manual
 Horrible phone




did not hold charge
 also, out of network too often
 yesterday, could not turn on phone
waste of my money
 mary r

This Phone works good just as described
 I think everyone should get one of these, Very good, Very good reception

i am so bummed
 i bought this phone after reading all the great reviews for my daughters first ever phone on her birthday
 she opened it and was so excited
 we are living in costa rica so i needed something unlocked
 i tried to activate it and put a local chip in only to find out its locked and i need a password to use it
 please don't sell a phone as unlocked if its locked

It had more features than I really wanted
 A bit more complicated for an older person like myself
 It works fine and it cranked right up

Brand new phone in original box
 It was exactly as advertised and worked perfectly when I swapped my SIM and memory cards
 My old 6350 was worn out after 2 years of use (and abuse), so this new 6350 is a perfect and low cost replacement that works great

Great phone very easy to use simple I love it works well price is great to 
camera works well to
I got this phone to replace my old Nokia
 It arrived new, but with no manual
 Not a huge deal
 It's my third Nokia, and I really am stuck on the brand
 It's durable
 Red isn't my favorite color, but I settled for it because of the price
 I was surprised that it's a nice deep red with a matte finish
 It works great for what I need which is mostly talking and minimal texting
 It works fine with my AT&T plan that I don't like to renew
 I don't see committing for 2 more years just for a free phone
 I gave it 4 stars because it lacks any good ring tones and message tones
 A little nit-picky, I know

Decent, simple to use for someone who just needs the phone to make calls
 Keys are big and well located
 My Mom loves it

If not into smartphones there is no finer product if you want a flawless phone and quick to the point messaging

I bought this phone to replace the one of the same model that I had had for 3 years
 I loved my phone but it just wasn't holding up any longer


the external screen gave up the ghost
 So I bought this one to replace it and I'm brand new again and loving it just as much as I loved the original
 Great size, feel, touch and just the features I need
 I highly recommend this phone for anybody that doesn't want a smart phone but just wants a good, solid, reliable phone for calls and texting

Cumbersome procedure in switching to speaker phone upon placing a call
 Prefer a standard phone ring rather than a musical tone and apparently impossible to do, even on a pay for ring basis, per IT rep in my office, other than through alarm feature, but sound on that is too low, even with highest volume setting (any suggestions on this point
)

It for my daddy he like it
This is great little phone
 The color red is good because you can always find it

Excellent
Beautiful and works very nice

the phone died after 6 months of use and I had to discard it, I looked very good phone good functions, basic camera but okay, very important features bluetooth, spekaer, and some games
 battery only lasted a day and a half very poor

Not a strong phone
 To expensive
 Smaller that the description
 Bad material
Easy to use and sturdy

The tones are very low
Purchased this phone brand new on Jan
 of this year
 (Paid $59
99)
 I couldn't even charge the battery with that phone
 It was dead
 It was defective
 I charged the battery with my old 6350 Nokia and after pressing the on button for at least 30 minutes it finally turned on only to have it turn off again after several weeks
 Just because a phone is brand new does not mean it is not defective
 Happy to report that I received a full refund from the seller

Very happy
Brand new and awesome deal

This is a great phone for someone like me, who's not good w/computers and the internet, but wants to have some access to the internet/email on their phones
 I know this phone does a lot more than I even yet know how to do w/it/use it for, and I'm hoping to learn more of that soon
 The camera and call quality is very good
 The only drawback is that the back cover sometimes starts to fall off too easily, after only a short while
 This is a great little phone, and I love the red color, too
 I'd definitely recommend it to people who want to have an excellent call quality phone and also get a taste of having data on their phone, w/out having to get a SmartPhone
 It texts easily, too, though I don't text myself
 I love this phone and have bought it several times over the years, as it's easy to use and has a lot of unexpected features
 I love the "Flip-Phone" part of it, too


very easy to open and shut quickly and small enough to easily keep in your pocket
 A very good buy for the money

I would like it to give me a direct link to address book like my old Nokia
 But otherwise it is good

The phone works fine, but the battery cover is very flimsy
 Even though the phone was kept carefully and not rough-handled, the back cover just fell off and now does not stick back on as firmly as before
Surprising low quality phone from Nokia
Phone is not unlocked
 Phone is mis-represented
 I did not get what I bought

Battery did not work
 Had to purchase another battery :(
This is my favorite phone, I love the flip design and easy too use
 I f you're looking for a simple phone this is it


Not too happy with what this phone has to offer
 Performance is good
 Variety not do good
This is my 2nd one
 I love it

excelent service and product
I bought this flip cell phone for my wife she loves-it
She like flip phones specially with brite collors like this one
We purchased because (1) unlocked, (2) used SIM card, (3) "3G" so we could use our AT&T microcell tower as our home reception is terrible
 Works much better than very old Moto RAZR V3 which were not "3G"
 Ring tones on phone were terrible
 I deleted all that I could & then downloaded (for FREE) several ring tones I liked at [


]
 We purchased two, thous one and a grey one
 Both are excellent

The phone had out dated software
 I still liked the phone but had no use for it
 As well, i returned it
 The company was cooperative with me

I bought this phone as the description said it is unlocked
 When I on the phone after placing my sim, I was asked to enter a pin to unlock the device
 This is falsely advertised
 Do not buy this phone

This phone meets the requirements I expected
 The flip design and the outside screen continues to be very modern and practical

Falsely advertised
 Phone was restricted
 Could not get a restriction code from my carrier, because it has an AT&T logo, locked by AT&T
 No code from AT&T because I was not their customer
 No help from Nokia, needed carrier to request the code from Nokia
 Returned phone without ever getting it to work

The phone is fairly easy to use
 Bought it for a lycamobile account I opened for my grandfather
 It was easy to set up the speed dial that he likes to use and he really enjoys the phone
 The only issue is that the volume on this phone is definitely not loud enough
 Also it's too easily to accidentally open up something that will use data

The Nokia 6350 arrived on time and securely packaged
 It is everything that is stated in the profile and I really like having this phone
 I added a 16GB micro SD card to store music on

My husband likes his Nokia Cell, however something is wrong with the battery and its off by itself every five to ten second and its hard to figure it out what's happening because no manual booklet came with the phone
 On top of that we love the cell phone

My SIM card was defective, though it worked in other phone
 They advised me to obtain a new SIM card from the same provider (red pocket), which I did, and really everything worked the best

battery with phone will not hold charge
way outdated
 get what you pay for

This was a cheap phone and I guess you get what you pay for
 It kept turning off 4 or 5 times a day at random times
 The battery doesn't hold a charge for more than 24 hours
 Too bad because I like the simple model, the screen is easy to read and I can carry it in my pocket
