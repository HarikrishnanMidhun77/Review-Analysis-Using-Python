 The back lighting is thorough and even and the raised buttons are tactile with a positive click response
 The camera was pretty decent considering it is only 2 megapixels

 It has the great calendar, alarm clock, text messaging, camera, missed/received call and other features of the C2, which makes it a keeper
 The OS seems very stable and snappy
Backup is a snap
 Same goes for the camera; I don't use it, can't speak to its quality, but if a camera is important to you this isn't the best choice
 I missed Cortana, the live tiles, the here maps, the am/fm radio, the rolodex style app list and contacts list and the dedicated camera button
 The camera isn't so good but that's the only thing negative about this phone
 While using the phone normally it is looks as good as any other screen, but when watching YouTube videos it's lack of pixels becomes apparent
 The only thing on the phone that seems to be somewhat damageable is the metal piece around the camera lens

 There are certainly better phone cameras out there, with the iPhone 5 and Lumia 920 blowing it out of the water
 For me it works best outdoors, as indoor shots tend to have more noise for whatever reason
 People say the camera is one of the weak points
 Image quality from camera falls a bit behind Lumia 950, but the price is unbeatable
The cellphone is very nice and with good characteristics so far, such as Display, the camera resolution, the Apps, the design
 Image quality from camera falls a bit behind Lumia 950, but the price is unbeatable
 Front facing camera isn't that good
good camera, phone is good; wi fi not as good as the model 640
 Sometimes miss amazing moments of photos of my kids because the phone freezes after taking a single picture
Solid phone, a mature Windows phone with an amazing camera, top battery life
 Windows 10 Mobile is a very capable operating system and provides a rather snappy tool at my fingertips
 This phone has the best camera I've used
The screen is absolutely CLEAR and there is nary a pixel to be seen
 Front facing camera isn't that good

 EXCELLENT camera
 I prefer the windows phone over Android and am very pleased with how the phone and camera performs
 It's so solid and excellent camera
 All the hardware shown in the description make the phone run smoothly in every action you make with it, the camera is fantastic and since the store doesn't have some of the official apps the community adds there own and work just fine
My husband and kids gave the phone for mothers day as a gift I love the camera and how fast it is
 But, after being used to Win 7 and to an iPhone 4s, I was not able to understand how it worked after a little bit of trying, it seemed to be focused on internet fun and not on the simpler functions of phone and text messaging, and I decided that I really don't want to learn yet another quirky operating system, namely with the "tiles
 At first, with the 4S, I could access my photos from my windows computer, but then that feature went away during some "update
 Phone display is impressive, camera is good, battery life good, speaker also okay
 Not to small not to big, love cortana, the camera, the phone overal
 It start with photo gallery not responding and then follow by everything disappear from the screen
 Only issue is camera is not better than Galaxy S5 during low light
 It has front camera, flash, 4G LTE etc
The phone fells good in the hand, the screen is really good for the density of pixels it has and the performance so far with games is decent
 The main camera is average but still better than older Lumias like 820 and 535
 The front facing camera is ok but if you want to upload selfies to Instagram will look washed out until you get a really good light to compensate the noise and lack of resolution
 My parents and some friends want some of this phones so I am going to order more but if you look for a better camera and better battery life look for the Lumia 640 XL
Phone is ok, a little big for my taste, but where it really fails is in the camera, the colors are not so bad, except the oranges
I like my phone but some apps wont work the same like facebook and messenger you cannot watch live im a teenager so that's important but other than some apps camera works fine fast phone nice screen size beautiful hd viewing
 Now this is meant to be my back up phone but with excellent battery life decent camera and fast performance it has become my main phone atleast until the Lumia 950 is released this is priced below its value you point
 The front and back camera are good, especially when combined with Lumia Selfie and Lumia Camera, allowing you to control a lot of elements in the photo

The camera on this phone is the best camera I have ever seen
 I can easily say that the camera is better than the camera I have on my Galaxy s6 edge + for sure
good phone same as the lumia 720 but needs app to be able to download the arlo security system too view my cameras
Yeah love this phone and its camera
I love this phone, its not that fast although its speed did not seem to decrease when several apps were opened but it has a good camera and takes decent photos in low light and good quality video with sufficient ambient light present

The camera is astounding, Windows 10 mobile is a great os
 There is no lag in any app I've ran and the camera is beyond wonderful
 I do love the camera on this phone
The phone is great, brought to Brazil, the best camera I had, and overall system is way faster then my old 640xl
Ok, the good: 1) It's compact and I love slider phones that cover up the keyboardAnd the bad: 1) It was a pain in the butt to figure out the configurations to get the mms to work, but that's part of getting an unlocked phone2) Every time I use the text to send to an email, the phone turns off and restarts3) The keyboard buttons are pretty flat & are close together so it's easy to hit the wrong button4) The camera quality is crap, but you can't really expect much from a phone like this5) The alarm feature worked like once
 2 drawbacks are: Sound could be louder when playing music from the phone's music app and 2nd, camera could be better
but in regards to the latter statement, I believe you can download any type of camera u want and use the downloaded camera for photos instead of the default camera

I loved it for the first few daysthen camera just diedI googled and found that it is common software problem with Lumia and Windows - automatic windows upgrade kills your camera; inserting storage card kills our camera
 So I have a very nice phone but without camera; I still have hope that Nokia and Microsoft will address it one day
 Apps were enough for video+music, camera, a driving navigator, a walking map, public transit, some Nokia proprietary apps that work well; like the panoramic camera app that stiches together about 4 pictures
 I don't know about pixels and all the criticism about camera but to me this phone is great phone great
 I don't know about pixels and all the criticism about camera but to me this phone is great phone great
 worst camera ever, there is nothing in the app market compared to Google Play
 The camera's on here could be a bit better but they serve their purpose
 The 720p screen isn't as bad as people think, everyone thinks its all about pixels, but you can get nice crisp 720p screens, just like this phone has
 -Camera button, i love having the separate button for just the camera
 After that, I still could not get it to access the network even after I went through troubleshooting with a tech for hours
 Order arrived two days later (free shipping),battery last for days, great camera and able to download free cool apps
Fast windows with excellent camera

 No camera, bluetooth or pc connectivity, but you can make calls and text
A solid dumb phone with possibly the longest battery life in its class; other people take its lack of camera and basic web functionality as a con but it is getting increasingly difficult to find a dumb phone with NO frills
 It will do SMS (slowly), but there's no camera, no data, no browser, nothing

This phone is great, light weight, easy to use, the camera is decent and it is very compact and fits in my pocket
 Great camera6
So far this phone is everything I expected; its easy to use, has a decent processor, stable software, good camera and lots of apps to download
But it has some limitations I was simply not expecting to see in a new Nokia phone:- The camera despite having a decent quality is has none of the basic options other simpler phones provide, it lacks filters, color modes, and even brigthness adjusment
 The camera is so much better than the one I had on my flip phone that I really can't complain
2 MP)-Wi-Fi-Pin Code Lock-Internet Radio-Data ManagementCONS:-Pain To Set Up-No front camera-Not many apps-Only A 2GB SD Card-No Brightness Control-Small Screen-Non-Removable BloatwareI would reccomend this to someone who is willing to sacrifice some smartphone luxuries without sacrificing them all to save a lot of cash
The camera is better than I expected (I wasnt expecting much)
 It survived several falls before that with ease, has a great camera and has both great touchscreen technology and buttons to push
Phone is Great, the camera is AWESOME, and unlocked with little or no bloatware is incredible
Great cellphone with an excelent camera
It will be hard to go back to regular digital cameras after using the camera on this phone
Pros:--battery life--solid voice quality--quick and smooth operating system--good predictive texting--threaded text messages--simple mp3 player--flashlight--web browser so slow you'll never be tempted to use it--little 2mp camera good enough for quick, unimportant picsCons:--has web browser--buttons a bit small (though I have huge hands and don't really have a difficult time navigating the buttons)--can't delete apps from menu--AT&T about to take down 2g network, leaving only TMobile's
 The camera not the best but I'm not a picture person so it's of no use to me
Good reception, good photos, but the headset does not fit well
 I took it into a retailer and they were able to fix it so I could send photos, the only problem is that it can't download large photo images from smartphones (and that's what everyone sends photos with these days)BATTERY IS AMAZING
be/ibP8Uv7JzKcFor features just click on this link http://youtu
I'm gonna add a few photos of the cellphone, I hope it can help you to make a better choice
 This very basic phone has a superb battery life, an OK camera, and served her needs perfectly
 It is light and the complete back casing where the phone's face snaps into the rear housing-case is good at eliminating dirt and what-not that tends to get into the back of phones
 It looks like a snap on video, but it's a serious impediment in real life, and I'm no weakling--I'm sure I could open it with the beyond normally required force, but I could have snap or break something inside rendering it less desirable
 It has a camera, bluetooth, radio and more

 The camera on this phone is quite basic, but it works if you are willing to wait for it to load
 The camera is not powerful, but anyway I see it as a plus
The phone I received was slightly different that the product photo
 I don't use the camera
only holds power for 15 hours (even when not used)Camera doesn't work as good as expected, and the thing, that protects the camera, fell of the first day
 the camera is ok for the price
 The camera on it is horrible, I had less expensive phones that had much better picture quality then this phone

 The camera on it is horrible, I had less expensive phones that had much better picture quality then this phone
its a very nice phone with a pretty nice camera
 The one inconvenience, as another reviewer pointed out, is the fact that there's no USB outlet or removable memory card on the 2720, so even though it takes photos, there's no simple, direct way to GET the photos from the phone to your computer
 Maybe snap a picture or two
 Only problem is the camera
 He likes the phone, however, it can neither send nor receive photos via text message
 I have no idea what this particular inlet model is called but I took a picture of it and will post it in the product photos
 Voice recorder and camera are functional
 Sound is good and camera is not that much , only limited
I rated only 4 stars because it's camera and loud speaker needs to be corrected/reformed
Photo camera is very good too - self portrate, panorama, smth else which I'm not going to use
Simple photo editor
Photo gallery supports timeline mode - see photos specific to this date, press right and left to go to next/prev date
The phone itself is nicely designed and offers pretty much exactly what you'd expect in terms of calls, texts, camera, etc
) Some of the expanded choices: alarms, camera, calculator, etc

 The USB cable (Nokia model CA-101) from my old phone worked perfectly with this one to connect it to my computer and drag/drop files and photos onto this phone
 My only real complaint about this phone is that it does not have full-screen photocall (like my old Nokia phone did) and it doesn't let me view photos as organized by folder from the mini SD card (just views them as if they were all in one huge folder unless you specifically save them to individual "albums" and then only view the album that contains the photo you want to view)
0 A Male to Micro B" for this phone and it is very nice quality cord that worked perfectly with this model of phone so I could transfer MP3s and photos and such between the phone and my Windows 7 computer
 The construction is good, but I got a better signal on my 6-year-old Nokia 5310, and it couldn't read the music and photos on my SIM card, only the address book
Other Small Issues:=Camera has no autofocus or flashlight
 It has the same camera, but it has a smaller screen and the 3G is not as fast
 The manufacturer label (and label under battery cover - see photos) showed clearly that this was the 301
I haven't tried the camera yet, but the software has so many point-and-shoot like features

 You can also actually shoot video much easier than the 520 (I still haven't found out how to without an extra app, heh)
Its fast, photo is very good
 There is almost no action that doesn't require at least 3-4 button clicks
It's classic Nokia - solid build, clear and logical user interface, real keyboard, good size clear display, camera that's fine for the occasional quick photo and it's affordable

 The built-in camera works well for its intended function - obviously not as good as similar cameras on smartphones but better than majority of cameras on other non-smartphones
 The camera is nice and delivers great photos, but when I am on a call and someone calls in via call-waiting, there isn't any tone or beep letting me know someone else is calling me

 It has all the features you would want in a phone -- excellent camera, super-fast GPS and mapping features, very large storage capacity, etc
 It is common while scrolling, you double click on something by mistake
 The camera works great even though it has no flash
+ intuitive interface super easy to use+good for a touch-screen beginner (hybrid between traditional and modern selective methods)+superfast camera+nice video quality+decent display+very light and compact, good design+comes with a pick for small objects on the screen (awesome)-not a very responsive touch-screen-image quality is sub-par-no flash ( are u serious
 I click on it and was hoping to see a "Go to place" link
 EVERYTIME I click on it, I keep forgetting that I have to ERASE everything I typed in before in order to enter new entry
) Then you have to click 'Options' again to hit 'Search'
) THEN you click that Address again (took me awhile to figure that out) to hit 'Drive to'
Although not a "smart phone" this compact device is feature-packed with a camera for stills and video, a real music player, a real FM radio using your headset as its antenna, Bluetooth and USB, and data storage on a mini SD card
Small in size, sufficient to fulfill all I need from a phone (basicall a cell phone and a camera), this is the fourth Nokia 5310 I have bought: one lost, another savaged by the dog, and one needing repairs, awaiting spare parts; I must be pleased with it 
really like the phone, the camera is great and the music player is even better
2mp camera
 Hopefully in the future manufacturers will address the camera quality since generally you carry this device everywhere

 In N81, you could make albums, navigate over the photos and edit them in few steps, but now, the 5800 does not offer you the album option, you can make a folder and put the photos in, but if you want to rotate them you can quickly do it but won't save the image like that, you need to go the edit to change it, which involves 4 or 5 steps, and once you save it, it takes the image out of the folder you put it in

Pros====-Good camera for a cellphone: 3
4) Forget about trying to take photos in less than perfect lighting- they will look grainy
The design of this phone is sober and elegant, providing some services such as wi-fi, radio, camera, web browser, audio recorder and calls recorder are wonderful
the touch screen is not as fast as an iPhone, but everything is compensated for all services that does not carry the iPhone, I'm really happy with my purchase and the truth I do not change my Nokia 5800 with iPhone neverThe flash of the camera is really strong,The design is ergonomic and fits comfortably in your hand
 The only thing I kinda dislike about it is the camera, because even though it has a 3
2MP camera with its flash and everything, pictures in dark places come out with bad quality most of the times
 The camera is good (not great) and I love the music library interface, comes with a free 8 GB Micro SD card
2 pixel camera/video, zoom, flashlight, red eye reduction, and etc like an iPhone without data plan

 The camera's great
This is a Cheap made in China phone with a very ugly camera and video quality, it takes terrible pictures
What I like about the phone:1/ It is very sleek and fits snugly in the hand2/ The voice quality and the speakers are excellent and have enough power3/ It has WiFi and Bluetooth4/ I am a stylus type of guy and I like the handwriting capability - probably the best feature5/ Changing the SIM or the SD is a snap
What I don't like1/ Making a phone call is pathetic - how many clicks do I have to make in order to make a simple phone call
 That resolved my issue with the number of clicks to make a simple phone call
 Having said that - I did not buy the phone because of the camera
 If you need a camera - "you buy a camera"
 There MUST be a way to pre-program your call-in numbers, and log-in with 1-2 'clicks'
3/ In order to access features there is a substantial time lapse between the moment the feature is activated ( you click) and the moment you can use the feature
 Video webcam available via 2 cameras, not locked on to a monthly $30 data plan like the Iphone, battery on par with my previous cell phones, touch screen is as good as it gets
 The phone works great clear LOUD speaker phone, great fun snap shoot digital camera, great flash abilities to stream web content, great call quality, very pretty screen

 The phone works great clear LOUD speaker phone, great fun snap shoot digital camera, great flash abilities to stream web content, great call quality, very pretty screen
 I have a minor concern with the battery cover, it seems like it was more of an afterthought in the design of the device, there is no buttons or latches to secure it, just a few tabs that u click it into
 Not a major overhaul on the operating system basically everything looks the same as previous nokia smart phones, the camera, video, and music interfaces could have made better use of finger controls in my opinion
 Excellent camera, video recorder, I even scan documents with it even if I have a scanner around
 Only negative point is the side's of video and photo, because i can't turn to right side to see a video, for exemple, it has only left side default
 As a media device it features second to none audio quality (with good encoding and headphones it sounds incredible), and a truly amazing screen for photo viewing and video playback
2MP camera with auto-focus, dual-LED flash and video recording (plus a 2nd front camera for video calling)

2 camera picture quality is too bad
camera really disappoint you
 anybody in your family or friend can access you photos,videos,masseges etc there is not even a simple pasword securiy on phone
 I ordered another camera
 Well with the new firmware nokia raise the cpu clock to 434mhz (d'oh the same as n97)-If you know how take pictures, you'll find 5800xm camera excellent even in low light condition-The GPS is kinda slow but once is connected is delightfull
 I wanted a reasonably priced smartphone that allowed access to the web, made phone calls, had gps, a decent camera, etc etc that was NOT an IPhone
 The phone has great features like wifi, Very good camera (two cameras), touch screen, and many applications
 the virtual keyboard does not open to enter automatically and the camera takes nice pictures but does not open easily and you must go through several steps between shots to save the picture and take another
 the virtual keyboard does not open to enter automatically and the camera takes nice pictures but does not open easily and you must go through several steps between shots to save the picture and take another
The signal is strong, the free GPS is great, the camera is excellent
 Lots of apps, all the bells and whistles you'd expect on a modern cell phone like a camera and Bluetooth, etc
 I gave it two stars because it texts OK and plays music OK, and the camera and other features seem to work OK
 The camera quality is excellent and there are many different options for editing your pictures and videos
 i also wanted a decent camera
The camera should be better
is an excellent choice if you are looking for a touch screen smart phone, I've had a phew touch screen phones in the past but this is the best one yet, the only thing that I wasn't 100% happy with is the camera is not a very good one when there is not much light, but the rest is fantastic, the different writing modes are the best, you won't even notice it's a touch screen, berceuse you can blast emails and SMS messages like with a keyboard cell phone
 with 16gb card can store a lot of photos, video and games
 I have used both cameras and the picture quality is great, the video feature is awesome as well
I think the Nokia 5800 meets almost all the worldwide communication market demands on a cellphone: Good call performance (voice and video), 3G browsing capability, WiFi, expandable SD capacity (up to 16Gb), decent camera for picture and video recording, really nice and versatile multi-format audio and video player, and a great sinergy-friendly operative system
 The camera operates better than the average cell phone
5) When I click on an event under the calendar, sometimes it opens the details of the event, but other times it opens a small window with the options of 'delete' or 'send'
 Of course, the OVI share experience to upload all her photos and receive comments from her friends and family, was what made her happy
 With the 5800XM simply click on the menu button and get out of there
Outside, the camera takes crystal clear pix
 The new firmware is also supposed to contain a camera enhancement
 The XM has both primary and secondary cameras
 For Example This will be my 3rd cell phone ever my first Nokia 3560 phone without a camera, second LG Cu500 has a camera and music player and 3rd Nokia 5800 Wifi, touchscreen watch and listen to media on the go
 The camera seems fine to me
 I do have to say the camera is not so great, so if you are looking for a good camera phone I would not buy this phone
 the camera quality is pretty good, I had a motorola a1200 before and although it was a 2
0 px camera the quality was amazing so I was worried that this one was not gonna be as good even though it had better resolution, but it's turned out real good
 What I can say is that the UI was designed with the correct balance of animation and snappiness (animation effects are turned off by default, activate them through Themes > General > Options > Theme Effects)
The phone's camera is quite decent in my opinion
 It shines in daylight conditions able to capture great photos and widescreen videos of surprising quality
 Overall, the phone's camera could be better given the quality of cameras on previous Nokia products, namely the N95, but this judgment is relative
 I believe, however the choice was made to make it affordable, given the fact that it also comes with a front-facing camera for video calls
2 camera, touchscreen, more customizable than iphone, external memory, etc etc
-MACRO of the camera is awesome
-The camera
 I needed multi-media messaging, video recording capabilities and a better camera
The PRO's: Great resolution, camera and sound; integrated wi-fi; good memory capacityThe CON's: Poor capacity to arrange the menus as you wish; no easy use of the touch screen as Palm-like graffity
 The camera gets dogged a lot, but in all actuality, it does a pretty good job when taking pictures in bright outdoor/indoor light
 The front facing camera is an outstanding feature and works very well
 The Video (which iPhone does not have at this time) is very exceptional as well; even more functional and better quality than the camera still shots (odd eh

 Too many double or triple clicks to do stuff
 Crappy camera
 Come'on Nokia you are supposed to be the phone camera kings
i just got this sweet phone from amazon a couple of weeks ago, and is a very good phone, it has nice features, the image is good, camera is good, touch screen is not as sensitive as the iphone, but is very good also
It's my first 3g phone and I really like it, ease to use, good screen quality but the camera is not good
 (you will have a hard time with 1-800-CAL-WHAT)iPhone killer: (differences with the iphone)Better CameraBetter Music playersturdierBetter upgrading optionsLower costBetter browserMature OS (with Flash)Support for A2DP bluettoth (clear sound in bluetooth headphones)Better screen ResolutionMore touchscreen inputs (like stylus and handwriting)2 cameras and support for video calls
 Every single time they had a lame excuse like the wrong IMEI (had to send them the photo of the phone, even that didn't help)
 The camera won't replace anyone's separate camera but is good for the random snapshots

 Nice camera, nice sound, good touch screen
I had owned various phones in the past and Nokia is the best on any comparison, for the Features available on this phone, had Apple had all these features it will cost 10 times more, most people don't even know it has extra camera on the front for video Calls along with the 3
 It has the great sync software that syncs all your photos, videos, contacts, notes etc between phone and PC using Bluetooth, just switch on the PC and it does the sync automatically
You can keep 4 contacts (with photo icons) on homescreen for quick calling, texting, etc
 Dialing can be a pain, you have to click several times to get to the point of calling a contact, but I have gotten accusotmed to that (same on N95)
 Nokia should really make it a 2 click process, select contact and call, hope they make that change
 Video and photos are sweet on the lcd screen
 Bluetooth makes transfer of photos and music from you computer to phone a snap

2 mg camera and video that are fun to use, 8gb of micro SD storage and easy USB connection to your computer for uploading your favorite tunes, which you can use for your ringtones
- There is a secondary camera
- Nice big screen (the glare issue could be corrected by buying a stick on anti-glare protection film)- GPS- Wireless connection- FM radio- Easy to transfer data to and from PC- Call quality is good- Expandable memoryCons:- Bad camera for its 3
5MP and Carl Zeiss lens, the image tend to come out pixelated with strong blue hues

 The camera quality isn't good with a 320Mp camera
 The camera is great
 Horrible camera4
As for cons, well I find it a bit unstable sometimes and I've had to reset it to factory settings twice cause certain features like the camera and music become unaccessible, and I don't even tinker with it much like some do by installing apps from other sites other than the store or installing custom firmware
 I love the music player, and the camera and video recording capabilities are awesome
2mp camera
 Hopefully in the future manufacturers will address the camera quality since generally you carry this device everywhere
2 megapixel camera (although I would only use it for emergencies, since the quality of small sensors is on the very low side)13

 In N81, you could make albums, navigate over the photos and edit them in few steps, but now, the 5800 does not offer you the album option, you can make a folder and put the photos in, but if you want to rotate them you can quickly do it but won't save the image like that, you need to go the edit to change it, which involves 4 or 5 steps, and once you save it, it takes the image out of the folder you put it in
 The camera produces excellent photos but do not rely on the auto mode to give you the best shots

4) Forget about trying to take photos in less than perfect lighting- they will look grainy
The design of this phone is sober and elegant, providing some services such as wi-fi, radio, camera, web browser, audio recorder and calls recorder are wonderful
the touch screen is not as fast as an iPhone, but everything is compensated for all services that does not carry the iPhone, I'm really happy with my purchase and the truth I do not change my Nokia 5800 with iPhone neverThe flash of the camera is really strong,The design is ergonomic and fits comfortably in your hand
 The only thing I kinda dislike about it is the camera, because even though it has a 3
2MP camera with its flash and everything, pictures in dark places come out with bad quality most of the times
 The camera is good (not great) and I love the music library interface, comes with a free 8 GB Micro SD card
2 pixel camera/video, zoom, flashlight, red eye reduction, and etc like an iPhone without data plan

 In spite of having a Carl Zeiss camera lens with LED flash, the pictures taken were not that good

 The camera is great and takes good pictures, the screen is gorgeous and looks nice when surfing the web
The Nokia 5800 is a good phone but has its downsides:Pros:- Touch screen is responsive- The full keyboard is spacious- Has a stylus but isn't really needed- Feels sturdy- Comes with 8GB of storage- Decent camera for a cell phone,- Internet browsing is decent- Comes with Wifi and Bluetooth- Good music player/radioCons:- The memory card is very hard to remove
 The phones music player is good and camera is not bad
 Excellent camera, video recorder, I even scan documents with it even if I have a scanner around
 Only negative point is the side's of video and photo, because i can't turn to right side to see a video, for exemple, it has only left side default
 The camera is nice and the video records fairly clear which is also nice
 I bought this because it had a decent video camera/camera(compared to my old Nokia) and the ability to browse the internet(my old Nokia could barely perform that function)
 This results in many mis-clicks which waste time and mobile bandwidth
I haven't tried any of the applications other than the camera
 Daylight pictures look pretty good for a camera phone
 I put some pictures I have taken with my other camera on the memory card and they look great on the screen and are really clear
 They won't show up in the music player until you click "Options" and "Refresh Library"
Pros:xpressmusic buttonFavorite contactsPretty good pictures and video (sometimes)Really nice screen for viewing photos/videosQWERTY keyboardTouch screen feels/works greatMusic playerMusic tones8GB cardCons:No delete all button for texts and contactsAlarm clock settingsUPDATE: I did end up finding how to change the settings on the alarm clock to turn vibrate off
 I've tried a couple of my brother's phones and his are harder to control with scrolling, swiping, and accidently clicking things
I love music and photography, so this phone was MADE for me
 The music function is absolutely the best, and the camera has great resolution (3
2 megapixel)
2 megapixel)
 I click on "accept the certificate and never ask again"
Pros====-Good camera for a cellphone: 3
 I guess the antenna is shot
 It does all the multi-media requirements that I want: MP3 music, videos at 640x360 resolution, GPS, Carl Zeiss Camera lens with flash, 16GB flash space, multi-tasking with open applications, and not to mention the call clarity when using voice calls
3mp photo on my desktop without data charges, or picture texting charges

 After a recent fire which burned down my building, I re-discovered the critical value of having even a bad camera on hand and available, if only by phone
 Hence I am forgiving of camera phones in general
 I've shot mostly indoors so far, and find that exposure ranges from unusable to good, grain is pretty bad in low lighting, but the flash is quite powerful
 I expect that like many cameras, broad daylight will reveal its best performance, and my good photos so far are really good
 I expect that like many cameras, broad daylight will reveal its best performance, and my good photos so far are really good
 There are tons of available settings however, and all around I think this camera spanks the 
3 mega pixel disaster I've had to rely on previously
 But I won't be throwing away my digital camera any time soon
OVI Suite makes life a little easier - backups, edits, map downloads, syncing, seamless so farEssentially UNDER priced given its capabilities (compare this phone to a 4-600 dollar newer phone)Feels like a true open-source, unlocked phone (unlike Google's ad machines and Apples prison-camp approach to technology)decent camera with functional macro lensCons:UI is not an A+ - more like a solid B

Cons:The camera takes somewhat good pictures, especially with the flash
 The camera does have focus problems in low and excessively bright light
 The camera does have focus problems in low and excessively bright light
 When I say focus problem, I'm not intimating that the pictures are blurry or look like you are taking pictures under water, but that they are not sharp
 This could be called "soft" focus
 The video camera takes video, not particularly sharp video, but it adequately gives you decent video images
 The camera/video part of this phone is not equivalent to a stand-alone camera, like my Panasonic Lumix
 It won't fast focus or quickly adjust to changes in available light
 The problem with the auto-shut off feature appears to be, that the screen goes off as it should, but if I leave the camera function on and then while the screen shuts down, it does not shut down the camera and the battery continues to be depleted as if the screen was on and I was using the camera
With consideration of all of the above, would I still buy this camera if I had it to do all over again
 I loved the camera, the touch screen, the long battery life, and even the qwerty keyboard
This is a Cheap made in China phone with a very ugly camera and video quality, it takes terrible pictures
What I like about the phone:1/ It is very sleek and fits snugly in the hand2/ The voice quality and the speakers are excellent and have enough power3/ It has WiFi and Bluetooth4/ I am a stylus type of guy and I like the handwriting capability - probably the best feature5/ Changing the SIM or the SD is a snap
What I don't like1/ Making a phone call is pathetic - how many clicks do I have to make in order to make a simple phone call
 That resolved my issue with the number of clicks to make a simple phone call
 Having said that - I did not buy the phone because of the camera
 If you need a camera - "you buy a camera"
 There MUST be a way to pre-program your call-in numbers, and log-in with 1-2 'clicks'
3/ In order to access features there is a substantial time lapse between the moment the feature is activated ( you click) and the moment you can use the feature
 Video webcam available via 2 cameras, not locked on to a monthly $30 data plan like the Iphone, battery on par with my previous cell phones, touch screen is as good as it gets
 The phone works great clear LOUD speaker phone, great fun snap shoot digital camera, great flash abilities to stream web content, great call quality, very pretty screen

 I have a minor concern with the battery cover, it seems like it was more of an afterthought in the design of the device, there is no buttons or latches to secure it, just a few tabs that u click it into
 Not a major overhaul on the operating system basically everything looks the same as previous nokia smart phones, the camera, video, and music interfaces could have made better use of finger controls in my opinion
] rebate debit card today 8/2/10 (Rebates always feel like a crap-shoot to me), so now I'm even happier with my first Nokia buying experience
 The camera's great
 However , the upper most left button malfunctioned after a few clicks
 I mean, it doesn't even have a camera
I recently bought this phone and it is beautiful, the camera takes clean pictures and stuff but i'm so disappointed because the phone is out dated and i've been trying to update it but so far no luck
 That one has aa flash for the camera and the one I received does not have flash ability 
 The camera is only 5mp
 However, the functionality and the capability are hardly noticeable when comparing the two in day-by-day operations (excluding the camera, because the Nokia 808 is an incredible camera that lets you make phone calls and organize your life)
 Forget about taking selfies as there is no front camera and no flash so forget about taking pictures in the dark
 It even has a decent camera see the included unedited photo

 I can take photo, they may not be top quality, but I'm not complaining
 I only wish the pictures had more pixels; but, over the years, I've taken some great shots with it

 SIM card replacement was a snap
 It takes photos, and records like a camcorder, this includes self timer, image sequence, brightness control, effects, whitness balance, and video share call16-There is a screen on the outside so you can see who is calling without opening the phoneAppearance1-Menu functions are easy to see
SIM cardTransfering my SIM card was a snap, so you know on this phone the SIM card slides into a slot with the little gold part facing up instead of down, and is located below where the battery goes
The camera , not bad for 2mp
 We do very little texting and do not have a data plan but it does has a camera and is very good
 But if you click again, oops you went too far
Using the camera more often than not required restarting the phone (otherwise it would say "Not Allowed")
 She wanted a new basic phone for a long time, one with a camera and bigger buttons
 The camera is even pretty good
 A big downfall is that the features aren't set up intuitively, it takes some getting used to finding simple things like changing your wall paper, finding the camera and ring tones in the menus
 When I took off the back of the phone to remove the battery so that I could install my SIM card, it was a real chore to get the back to "click" in
 The phone is small, fits nicely in the pocket and has a camera that isn't too bad
 If my Dad really stops and focuses he can read a text message, but you can only make the text so big
Nice phone, the camera is pretty decent too
camera works well to
the phone died after 6 months of use and I had to discard it, I looked very good phone good functions, basic camera but okay, very important features bluetooth, spekaer, and some games
 The camera and call quality is very good
