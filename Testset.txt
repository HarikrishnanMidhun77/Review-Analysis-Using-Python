my daughter liked it for a few days and then i didnt see it anymore on the phone
 Use your judgement on that one

very good charger, it woks fine, no complaints!!! I would recommend it!! It was good, but not using it anymore!
This product arrived when promised and in the condition promised
 It is a genuine Blackberry charger
 It was brand new and worked perfectly
 For the price, I don't think you can ask for much more than that!
Great product
 Use this with my Galaxy S4
 At this price I bought 2 more
 One for work and one to keep in the car incase I ever travel and forget my charger

Honestly I have always loved this specific model, since you can just take it with you on the road not worrying if you end up losing it or leaving it where ever you go
 Though it doesn't exactly meet the fast charging needs of high end phones, it works pretty well on all of them, you just need to be patient

I've had this charger well over a year now, and it still works perfectly
  Most chargers would have broken by now
  The folding blades make this more portable than the chargers that come with some Blackberry models that have adapters for different countries

so far no problems, it charges fast that is what i need it
 it doesn' have an USB as it specified, jus a direct wall charger

Great ! So far
I had this charger before and it seem to last pretty good 3 years fits most phones except Iphone and Galaxy 5  but that phone can still use it in the right side of the portal it will Judy charge it a bit slower
 When this charger goes it tends to loose it's fit firmly in usb and has a short

Another very good phone charger that does the job and has a  very affordable price that anyone can afford  to buy it

Works well
 We use this for travel and it lives in our luggage most of the year
 For the low price having an extra USB charger this works great
 Charges our Galaxy S3 and Note 2

I needed a charger quick and I didn't want to spend $20
00 at the convenience store for a short, crappy charger
 For this price, the charger is great
Pros: The cord length is perfect if you have a tall bed
 I don't have to struggle to see my phone when I'm laying down
Cons: The plug in is a little blocky but nothing to worry about
 The connecter doesn't like to stay in place 100% of the time
 It does NOT fall out but if you wiggle it just right it disconnects the charge
 My phone is also old and the port is a little worn
 That could be my issue
If you need a good charger for a cheap price
 Buy this!
Bought as a spare charger for the house and turned into my main charger because my other one failed
 Nice long cable and has held up for tons of charges for my Galaxy S3

The charger only lasted a week ad after that it just stopped charging my Samsung Galaxy S3
  They really need to start making these chargers better



I've been thru several!!!!
This Charger is awesome! First of all I wasn't expecting it until between 12/12  and 12/17, but it arrived on 12/11,So That was a plus for me! Second, I was kinda skeptical about purchasing it because it says that its for a Galaxy S and Blackberry so that can mean a lot of things! but I figured what the heck its cheap, so what can I loose!  Well, I just got it today and decided to give it a try at work on my Galaxy S4,  it charged  from 80%  to 100%  in about 7 minutes!! Yes i timed it!  and also the cord is long which is a plus for me!  So if your looking for a fast charger with a long cord and not to mention a great price, this is the one!!update:  not sure what the other reviewer meant by saying these are poor quality chargers, because I've had mine for a little over 2 weeks and it's still going strong!!  Love this charger  especially  for the length!!
I purchase this for a backup at work
  It charges my SGS4
  I would recommend this charger for the Samsung Galaxy S4

This charger woks wonderfully on the Samsung Galaxy S4
  it chargers the phone fast and the price is great!  Highly Recommended product!
This is another great product and i will always order from here in the future
 money spent well!! If you need a great car charger this is the one you need!!
goes into the lighter port a little rough but it charges the phone fine
 I wish it had a little more reach so i could use the phone from the passenger seat of the car more comfortably but its not a big problem
 it will reach pretty far because of the coiled section but this will put stress on the charge port of your phone which many people dont realize will eventually break it

I purchased two of these chargers for my sister and girlfriend
 They both have Samsung Galaxy phones and needed a car charger so being the OEM fanboy I am, I swooped up on a couple of these for them while remaining slightly skeptical of what was actually going to show up in the mail at this price
I'm happy to report I definitely received 2 OEM Samsung car chargers in the mail in sealed bags with part # barcodes (the kind you'd normally receive in a new/refurb phone)
 Can't go wrong with the price and certainly can't argue with the benefits of OEM vs
 generic (mA output and reliability at the top of the list!)

I bought this for my Samsung Charge
 It works perfectly and is built as solidly as the $20 Verizon charger
 I highly recommend this car charger and thanks for the great price!
It does what it needs to do, very pleased
 I bought some other cheap lame one and will never go back

Charger works great
 Haven't had any issues with it at all
 I wish it has a retractable cord like some other chargers I've used, but other than that, I love it

It works great  thus  far no issues
  The only thing i might have limited was a usb Connect or it charges my t989 without fail
The big store that is in every town now (can't say their name) either does not carry anything or is always out of stock
 If they ever have anything is stock, it is cheap junk that does not last
 I got this cord thru amazon for a fraction of the price I usually pay for the junk at that big national store
 This cord works perfectly and has lasted for months now
 I also bought at the same time 2 other cheaper charger cords thru amazon that work perfectly
 Since this one still works, I have the other two to fall back on when this one finally goes out
 This is a great car charger, and it does not cost near as much as the junk you get at the local store--not to mention this is the Samsung brand charger verses their junk

Good lengthEasy to useVery fast chargingI would recommend it to persons who use their phone a lot

luving it  right now will last about 4 mo so you cant beat the price for it I got 4 of them
JUNK!!!





This product must be miss labeled
  I can not get my Samsung S2 phone to charge with this OEM charger
  The lights are on, the phone says its charging but nothing happens
  I am not sure if I got a defective product but it is very upsetting to sit in your car for hours and not see your phone recharge
  If you need a reliable charger, DO NOT purchase this product
If you need a car charger for your Samsung S2, I would recommend the Motorola Vehicle Power Adapter
  It charges fast and is dependable

A very good car charger for your phones, charged my phone pretty quickly and quite affordable, I recommend it to anyone to have as a back up to your charger

The Samsung car charger has stopped working within a 6 month period
  I thought a fuse was blown inside the unit but when I attempted to change it, I've noticed that it doesn't come apart like most vehicle chargers

WHAT A GREAT PRICE!RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX, PLUG N UPLOAD SUM JUICE 


DON'T KNOW IF DROPPING IT REPEATEDLY ON THE FLOORBOARD,OR OCCASIONALLY STUFFING IT IN CONSOLE TO HIDE CAUSED FAILURE 


BUT SOON THE GREEN LIGHT FAILED TO LIGHT, AND PHONES DISPLAY SHOWEDIT WASN'T CHARGING
 SO EITHER SPEND SEVERAL MORE DOLLARS FOR ONE WITHA HEAVIER CORD/STRONGER SHELL OR TREAT IT AS A DELICATE FLOWER

Sprint wanted $30 fro the same item
  This is OEM and not third party after market
 Bought two
  Work great
Plugged into the car and worked the first couple of days
 Hasn't worked since
 My phone does not even recognize it's plugged in

This charger works great
 I love the fact that the LED on it does not light up until it is plugged into the phone
 Great bargain

Though I`m not a expert in cell phone chargers
 This thing works good, but its not all fireworks and hotel parties
 Its a charger and it works so I guess buy it

I used this charger for a couple of months now
 Its a very good charger
 It charges my phone very quickly

It is Samsung brand

works with my Android phones

Galaxy Nexus 4 and Galaxy S2 and S3


recommend it highly for anyone with a microUSB phone
I needed a car charger and this was very affordable and it worksgreat! The same thing from the store was three times the price

good oem car charger, i originally bought it for my galaxy S2 and later on that week I upgrated to the Galaxy S3 and it works prefectly fine, I would recommend this product
You have to hold it in a certain place in other for it to charge
 I'll just buy the Verizon  charger instead
This charger works perfectly
  It is the official Samsung charger so I was sure it would work just fine
 I highly recommend it

I use this charger with my GS2 from Straight Talk
  This charger is working as expected, charges the phone fine and seems like a quality product, not flimsy and cheap feeling like some chargers I have ordered in the past

This thing worked well when it actually functioned, but today it stopped working and I am past the 30 day return window by 10 days give or take
I'm guessing the quality might not be great as that is why it stopped working, who knows

 What a waste of money

Hope to use it soon
  My other one worked sometimes
  This one does not have the light on unless you are charging

es un cable para carro de excelente calidad , original de samsung , lo tengo algun tiempo sin ningun problema
I went thru 3 car charges which they all either stopped working after a few uses or never worked to begin with
This car harder not only works it also charges my phone lightening fast!!! LOVE IT, LOVE IT LOVE IT!!If u are debating u can rest assured this thing is awesome

First, this is kind of cheap-looking, but I did try to buy the cheapest OEM car charger I could for my phone, so that's forgiveable
  The springs on the side don't have much force, though, so this is constantly slipping out of the 12V car port
  The cable is sturdy, but the rubber near the connector is kind of stiff, which makes charging AND operating your phone on the go a bit of a hassle
  It's held up well since I purchased it though
UPDATE:  Stopped charging after a month

I've been using this for about 4 months now and it works just as it is intended
  I would buy again
  Quality product
The cord could stand to be a little longer, but it is of a decent length

Works great nice long cord
 Does the trick
 Bought several of these to put in diff
 rooms & one for work

Good charger and is perfect because it is also has a USB connection
 Also love that it is original material it works like that too giving a quick charge when i need it

I have had 3 phone chargers go bad in two weeks
 I can not say where I purchased them
 Most chargers for cell phones are cheaply made
 This one is OK I guess

Got this to replace a frayed OEM cord
 The cord itself is ok ;however, the plug that looks like OEM and is stamped as such, is crap! Took 8 times longer to charge with this unit! When the cord was paired with the actual OEM plug in, it worked fine
 So if you need a cord its ok; however, it is definitely not OEM and the plug is worthless
 For the price and really just needing a cord it is a good value but I am very disappointed with the false markings as OEM when it is certainly not

I received this product in a very timely manner which was delightful, however, I gave it as a gift and was embarrassed to find out it was a defective item
 I was reimbursed for the product but would have much rather had a product that worked the first time

It worked fine for a few days then I had to change to cord







The charger itself working fine up to this point









Rather than send it back I bought another cord from sprint for $19
00
fast delivery, works well
 Not very long

I thought this would be a Samsung product but look like a cheap counterfiet
 It came crushed and is slow to charge my phone

This detachable sansung galaxy s2 travel charger is simply good
 It works perfectly
  The cherry on the cake is because it is longer than the factory original l received with the phone

Had all the marking of a legit samsung product but the cord stop working after 3 days
 I'm not upset because it was very inexpensive but maybe you should spend a little more and buy a better product off amazon
 When it did work it worked very well

First off, the charger works just as it should and all the ports stay connected just fine
People in other reviews were complaining that the cord was too short-- about 2 or 3 feet-- and that was what I was expecting
 Instead, I got a 5 foot cord which is a bit long for the purpose I was going to use it for (in my car)
 Now I have a long cord dangling everywhere
 That extra length may be a bonus for most, but I bumped down the rating due to seller's lack of description and/or consistency
 Also I'm fairly certain the product image was changed because when I ordered it, a different style adapter was pictured


 I was expecting a square shape with the USB port on the side; I got the longer rectangle shape with the USB port on the end


 hmm
 There's no way to verify that now
In sum: Good charger with good connectivity, looks and acts like it's an original Samsung
  Cord length and adapter style may vary as it seems like the seller is not consistent

it's a charger for dirt cheap and the shipping wasn't more than the item
 I wish they had the batteries i needed as well for my phone
 but great all an all
although i do not use the charger, the cable is useful
  it is longer than what is given with the phone
  the additional length allows the phone to be placed in plain sight, instead of down by the wall receptical
This charger doesn't charge the battery of my Samsung Galaxy S2 (i9100) properly
When I connect it to my S2, the screen gets frozen and the cell behaves in a unusual (abnormal) way

This charger is exactly like the original one that came with my phone
  It is most definitely a good buy for the price!
works good with our phones, better actually than the charger that came with one of the phones initially , great price
Was here right on time
Wall adapter what I expected and works well but dose Not Have Quick-Charge As This ad states and that was the,Whole reason I chose this chager so that is horribly disappointing and inconvenient 




 The micro usb is useless it looks and acts cheaply made, and dose not fit well in to ports an either end will periodically stop working and my phone will freeze and turn off periodically as well



I know its the usd because I tried it in several devices and adapters and it had the same problems



I Will never order from Amazon Again Only two orders out of 13 have come without Defect or Wrong Probuct!Ugh!
I haven't had any problems with it
  It just like the oringal charger that comes with the Galaxy S 2

I would like to start off by saying that this product is what I ordered and I have no complaints about shipping or the condition of the product when it came to my house, the problem I do have is the micro usb cable that comes with the charger
 Why is it that all of the different companies that sell chargers on Amazon can get the plug part of the charger right but not the micro usb cord? The cord is cheap and not the original cord that comes with the other part of the charger
 I am having the same issue with the charger that I ordered for my galaxy note 2
 It's a very thin cord, and also very short
 Maybe, a 2 21/2 foot cord? And its of a cheaper quality than the part of the charger that the micro usb plugs into



thank you
 it did not disappoint
 was as expected and does the job though I am going to a new phone as the galaxy 2 has been acting up consistently
 shutting down by surprise etc



I love it
  It charges my phone quickly and the cord is super long
  I leave it at home but will purchase another to leave at work

In a nutshell, this is NOT an OEM charger
  Although it has the Samsung markings, it doesn't seat well with a Samsung phone
  This means that it's either meant for another market or it's counterfeit
  With that said, I wouldn't buy this again
~~~~~~~~~~August 17, 2013 - UpdateThe seller tried to make amends by sending me three replacement chargers
  After using this for a while, it is still garbage
  It does not charge my phone and in fact, it drains the phone
  This must be a counterfeit product
  It has Samsung markings but it does not charge the phone
  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!
After 2 weeks my charger just fell apart while i was taking it from the plug , not a strong charger at all i would have asked for my money but it wasn't even worth it 

I am pleased with this purchase
  The detachable cable option gives very good flexibility for use with other USB cable chargers
  Good quality for a travel charger

charges me up all the way
 doubles my battery liek promised
 case protects well and the color is awesome nice
The color is amazing all of my friends are jealous and ask me where did I get it
 They are even more jealous when I tell them how much I paid for it! Great case, powers me up and VERY stylish
 Matches my 5C PERFECTLY :)
much slimmer than I thought and it ads 125% battery
 I am charged for the full day with this case

Great quality product , I love this case it is the perfect sidekick to an always dyeing phone 
 Now my phone is charged anywhere anytime thanks to powerbear 
 Really like the name of the case as well !! 5 stars deff !
This case helps me run my day smoothly without having to worry about my phone dying
 Plus the color is very beautiful

Bought one for me and another for the wife
 Acts as phone protector and charging case in one
 Hold charge all day so no complaints

This PowerBear case is a lifesaver!! Charges fast, always reliable
 I also love the glossy texture of the case
 Highly recommend!!
This is a very well built and designed case,with a very cool and attractive color
 Phone dies too quickly without it
I was surprised it game in three steps, but when i put the case together and slid my phone in, i loved it
 It is hard to get off
I was looking for something different to my wife and this case its strong and beautiful
 Good price and i recommend it

Love it this case is just what I expected and I love the design, it is slim and protects my case more than I thought it would

this is really cute phone case, i like it alot, and it came in when it stated it would too
Really cute but the heart doesn't really show up if you have the white iPhone 4
 3 piece case & fits like a glove, looks really cute
 Shipping took about 2-3 weeks but really enjoy the case
 Do recommend

This one came in broken  The bottom pice snaps on to the sides and the main backing is a inlay piece
 Came in scuffed with paint and the pieces will not click in together
 If it was not broken I would like it
 Also if it wasn't in three click in pieces
Great case for my phone
 Protects and keeps me charged
 easy access to the button and sounds good too
 i like it
Other power cases muffled the speaker sound
 This one had a great sound port on the back for clear listening

Wow!  What a cute battery case! I saw a Christian sister with one of these on her phone!  That gave ne an idea-I decided to order me and my sister a battery case-mine is white, (since my phone is white), and my sister's is black,(since her phone is blue)
Anyway, these little guys give you power for your phone! If we run out juice, especially when on the go, we can just connect this case to our phone, and it is POWER ON THE GO!! (I'm just concerned about the functionality)

Great case
 Doubled my battery life like promised
 Can't beat the price
 I would recommend it for a friend
 A+
Great case, sturdy, doubles battery, wont have to worry any more
 I purchased this for my kid and he is very HAPPY

Bought one for me and the wife (diff color;phone, not  wife, lol
)
 Firefighter work 24 hr shift and never know when if will get to recharge so this is perfect for me and anyone else that can't always plug in to charge each day

I used to be obsessed with changing phone cases, but now I am obsessed with THIS phone case!! What a great find !! 5 STARS
couldnt watch movies on the htc without the battery dying
 the phone is great for entertainment
 but battery could be better
 the powerbear cases is a great fit and a good kick stand on teh back for entertainment
 im sold
This product is great
 I like the kickstand on the back
 The power indicator is very convenient to know charge pack status

Not Many HTC one battery cases for sale and this one is pretty good for the price
 I would give it 4
5 stars and 5 if the price was $5 cheaper

I never do this, but I almost bought this product based off of the amazing sounding fake reviews provided by the shills for PowerBear
 If you look at all the positive reviews for this case, you will see that none of them are verified purchases and yet every negative review, other than this one of course, is a verified purchase
 What that means is that everyone who has actually bought and used this product thinks that it is crap
 Furthermore, many of the reviewers have posted twice on this product, once per color
 Why Amazon allows this is beyond me, but that is not the point
 Also, if you look at the profiles of the positive reviewers, you will see that they have posted multiple positive reviews for PowerBear products and many of the reviews are carbon copies of each other
 Beware the paid shills!
This is absolutely amazing, more than doubles my battery life, so I can forget about carrying my charger all the time
For such a good price, this is just the right deal
 A++++++++
Bought case for me and wife to qualify for free shipping
 Came in different colors to match phone
  Can go entire 24 hours without charging; but I am not a kid playing games all day long
 No complaints or problems
 (Personally I wrote another review in the wrong spot since we had diff phones and diff colors I f&%$ up)
Since I am always on my phone, the battery life is very short
 After purchasing this battery case I am no longer worried about running out of battery life

Watch-out, all these positive reviews are fake
 Some have even reviewed it twice using the same name
 What a sleazy way to sell an item

My brother just got the HTC One, and I promised him an awesome case like the one I have for my S4
Super sleek look, fits well, doesn't get overheated and saves the day every now and then! Especially when GPS is needed!
The color pops out so well
 Clips well to my phone and charges me up
 I cant complain! No cons!
The raised edges protect the screens from falls
 The battery case looks stylish and charges me up
 This case is fannnnntastic
fits well on the phone and it is easy to use
 the price is unbeatable and the product works like advertised
The S5 is a fantastic phone
 However because of its large screen the phone dies quickly
 With the extended battery I am able to enjoy all of the phones features without losing power
 Great buy

Totally worth the money, It protects my phone in even of the most dangerous situations where I dropped my phone and it also keeps my battery going for Days
 BRAVO!
I got this case for my nephew, and he claims that it was not what he expected
 He has a charge case for his last phone, and it covered the whole thing
 This is just like a back of the phone replacement, so it doesn't add to much weight
This is a really great case, looks and feels amazing, not to mention that the battery lasts for many hours

I think this case is an excellent choice, since it is not so bulky, the color is nice, the texture on the back is good for gripping, and it extends battery life
 It's a life saver, and there isn't too much on the market at the time for this phone so I am happy with it
 Bought both blue and black for me and my brother right after we got home from the phone store
 Would recommend

compre este Case hace varios meses y protege el celular de manera excelente

ni siquiera tube que comprar protector de pantalla y gracias a dios mi cel este nuevo


I was looking for a case for my new Galaxy S2 (At&t version)
 The store was selling similar cases for $20 and $35
 I just can't justify spending that much on a case
 This case is made for the unlocked version of the Galaxy S2
 The size is the same
 The only difference that I can see is the noise cancelling microphone is blocked
 I drilled a little hole in the case and it works just fine
i was raving to a friend about how amazon has great phone cases and how cheap they are and bought him this
 it didn't even fit his phone right
 poorly made

nice case, protective and good looking, it also has a nice changing texture in some areas
 good buy for the price
Bought this for my new AT&T; Galaxy SII, the case arrived super fast, its fits the phone perfectly and snug
 I have no issues with any buttons, and the rubber is in a smooth, sort of laminated finish
 It does not stick to your pockets
 Overall, I am extremely happy with the purchase, especially for so cheap
And just FYI: This is for the AT&T; (i777), or International (i9100) Galaxy SII
This WILL NOT FIT Sprint, T-Mobile or the AT&T; Galaxy SII Skyrocket phones
 You've been warned

I liked the case, and for the amount of money paid, its a good buy, i personally like stronger cases, this is very flexible and indeed looks like a hard case, a little bit of more firmness wouldnt hurt
Protects VERY well the phone as well as the camera lens there is not one single part of the phone touching the surface of the table when i leave it there
 Very Good purchase

I bought this for the at&t samsung galaxy s2 and the seller was very slow in getting this item to me
 I also notice that this product do fit the SGS2, but the cut outs was NOT good
 The cut out opening was too small for the power button, there was also an extra cut out for no reason
 It does fit nice so I gave it 2 stars, but bad opening for my phone will be costly

Like most of the other reviews say, this rubbery case has a smooth exterior, so it doesn't feel like an uncomfortable sticky rubber
  While still appearing to have a hard shell, the rubber itself is fairly soft, and does a great job of protecting from falls without feeling too bulky

the case did not fit my phone; was a tad too small
  i could only get 3 corners into the case
  i wound up buying a two piece case that cost about $20 from a local store
  have dropped the phone so many times the case is beat to s***, and no damage to the phone
  good reason to buy a case, just not this one
my co-worker delayed in getting a case because he could not find one he liked, and broke the display screen, making his phone unusable
  buy a case, not this rubber thing
  i threw mine away within 5 minutes of it's arrival
This skin fits perfect in my SGSII and the phone looks great inside of it
It is a high quality skin and gives a very good feeling in your hands
I recommend this product for your SGSII

I prefer this style case to the otterbox and case mate as I feel it provides ample protection without turning the phone into a brick
 Lightweight and sleek

I like the case so far fits ok my Samsung Galaxy S2 I like that is very shiny and soft to the touch
 My only concern is one of the corners is not totally covered so it wont protect it from scratches or a hit there that is why I am just giving it 4 stars
 Well for the price i think it is ok

Don't expect more but it works well for the reason you buy
I was looking for a cheap skin case and was not willing to pay a hefty amount for the case at least for the initial period after buying my unlocked galaxy s II
Din't Expect much before buying
But it really does work well
4 $ with 2 day shipping free is really a good deal if you are looking for a perfect tpu case protecting your phone

Great case fit my samsung galaxy s2 great will order again fast shipping it make my phone look super sexy trust me you need to order 1

I read the first few reviews and didn't read any further and now I wish I had cause this thing does not work for the Sprint Galaxy s2
 Wish I had known that

Be careful when ordering these cases
 Not all Galaxy II's are the same
 Mine was a Sprint and this one did not fit my pnone
 It went into the trash can as it wasnt worth sending back
 Otherwise I am sure it's a great case

arrive on time, good quality, functionally, recomend to protect the samsung galaxy S 2 I9100, fit exactly , recomend to the owners of this smartphone 

I was expecting a bit higher quality product but it is what it is
 I've used it for a few months and it definitely helped when I dropped my phone
 But at this point, I am not using it anymore due to the quality of the product, although 'good', it could be better and more solid

there is a different between the size/design of Galaxy II that is carried by USA and what's carried by Asia
  I'm in USA, I ordered the cover for Galaxy II that i bought from USA, the cover didn't fit, and the speaker location is different from the phone
  I copmared the cover to another Galaxy II that is sold in Asia and i found that the design is different
So if you bought Galaxy II from USA, don't buy cover from outside USA
It is good, and look so cute
 I like it
 It is cheap than when i saw in a store

I made a good choice whenI thought of buying this, its very safe, & not to bulky! Overall very satisfied customer

Very satisfied with my purchase
 The quality is good and the shipping is quick
 The case provides enough friction to enable a good grip on the phone
 TPU (the plastic material where the case is made of) virtually resists oil and dust
 I used to have an Otter box for my other phone
 The protection is excellent BUT the silicone attracts dust like crazy
 The S-Style pattern at the back is more of a personal taste - some people like it but some other may not
 To me it adds some flavor to an otherwise plain black case
 The protection on all 4 sides on the front panel looks sufficient (anyone dare to slam your phone on the floor to test it out?)
 I wish the top margin (above the earphone) can wrap down by a few mm
 Overall I feel my phone secured in the case

totally awesome, It was made with good quality and I would purchase this again in another color it still looks new!
this case is better than i thought i love the feel and design and it is well made and doen not collect dust

This product arrived quickly
 It fits my HTC and is easy to get on and off, I have no complaints

Great Grip, Great Style, Gerat Durability, Great PRICE! Lasts long
 SLIM FIT! Should be included in every HTC sensation purchase and if it was it may have beaten the iPhone 5! Too bad HTC
A note of caution from someone who owned and used just about every major Blackberry model: if you already own a standard USB 2
0 cable and you don't need an extra, then you do NOT need this cable
 All a Blackberry needs for data transfer is a STANDARD USB 2
0 cable with a Micro-USB connector at one end
There is NOTHING special about this cable and nothing justifies the artificially inflated MSRP listed for it
 While this item is sold at a 90% off the MSRP discount, it's probably okay to purchase one, for as long as, after reading the first paragraph you decide that you will need a USB 2
0 cable
The items has 2 stars taken away for the exaggerated marketing claim (professional grade custom cable) and for the inflated MSRP
NOTE: Please make sure that you buy cable with a MICRO-USB connector because this is what your Blackberry needs

this is a good product is just a usb cable it work perfect just like a oem cable
 
 

Well, went on the internet first



$14
00, then to a very well known store, here in Gloucester, MA, $28
  I was not happy
  Then, of course, I knew Amazon would come up with something


they did, $4
00 and change


it arrived promptly
  I cannot say enough about Amazon, they are realistic in their prices, knowing that people do not have that kind of money to pay for a wire,,for 14 or 28 dollars
 I have never been so happy to get what I need without spending my last dollar for it
  Thank you again and again

I would like a extra cable for my smartphones at work, so I purchased this one
 Nothing special as long as it is working, and it is
No complain

There is a difference in USB cables
  On some computers, including mine, the USB ports are underpowered, and some poor cables do not transmit data well
  I have purchased some cheaper cables that would not transmit data between my computer and my Blackberry Storm 9530
  This cable works great, even with my underpowered USB ports

I bought this micro usb cable because it was cheap, and that it is
 I use this with my Nexus s 4g from sprint and although it does indeed charge my device it causes some major issues, such as screen lag, my computer not being able to recognize what kind of device this is, and causing my phone to constantly jump into car mode
 So if you need a real quick cable for basic charging, this will do it, anything else


spend the extra buck on a higher end cable

I purchased 3 of these cables because they were cheap and got good reviews
  I don't know how people are getting these cables to work


 but out of the 3 I bought, 0 have functioned properly with my Palm Pre!  The best I can do is get it to charge, though the entire time it is charging the computer is complaining about "Unknown Device" and "Could not install drivers" even though it works beautifully with the original cable
  The only setting that works is "Just Charge"!  Each of the 3 cables fails slightly differently which makes me believe that each has a different flaw!  I've tried this with my Wife's Palm Pixi as well as used different computers and that failed as well
  Look elsewhere when attempting to purchase a cable for your Palm device!
this phone cord is so easy to use and easily connected from phone to computer
 great value for the price

This cable is better than original
  Never any issues with phone recognizing USB connection, as the original does, when plugged to PC

I bought this recently and did not expect much, as it was only $2
99 shipped to my door
  For that much money, how can you go wrong?  So, I have not used it to transfer data yet, as it it plugged into my PC at work just for charging
  When plugged in, my Palm Pixi prompts me, just as the factory cable does, to transfer or charge
  I have used this cable about 10x to charge now, and it works great!  Do not hesitate to purchase this if you need another cable, or two!
A good inexpensive cable that works like the original
  I purchased this cable because I wanted one that would work with the touch stone I just purchased
  After reading several reviews and looking at competing cables I deciding on this one
  While several inches shorter (40") than the original it works well and with the touch stone
  I used this cable mainly for use in the car

The cable worked great with the pre if you need an extra one, but I suggest purchasing the whole unit--plug and all, not just the cable, because with shipping and handling it gets to be the same price

not much to say about a wall charger except it charges my bluetooth perfectly
  I'm glad I bought it
  Thank you!
This charger does the trick
  The charger in my car doesn't work when the ignition is off, and who wants a dangling cord hanging down in their field of vision while driving
Have charged the T505 up once since I got it, and the battery life is reported to be around 18 hours of usage or 30 days of standby
  I may charge it every couple of weeks
  Very convenient accessory

The Motorola T505 doesn't come with an AC charger, only a DC charger
 This makes a great addition to the package
 You can charge in your home at night

I was initially leary about purchasing this item due to the extremely low price and to have free shipping also, but I needed a wall charger since Motorola only includes a car charger with their wireless car phone speakers
  So I took a chance (due to the low price and free shipping) and was pleasantly surprised
  The charger appears to as well made as the other after market chargers I purchased previously for my e-book reader, PDA, camera, etc
, and at less than 25% of the cost
  I charged my Motorola speaker without any problems

we bought this charging cord because the t505 only came with a car charger
  we now have 2 t505 with the 2nd one intended for use with connecting our bluetooth enabled phones with the home stereo
  this cord offers a convenient way to charge both as we are not in the car for long enough periods for the device to charge completely while travelling
  by bringing in the devices we are able to charge overnight to a full charge
  great price and no complaints with receipt of material in either packaging or transit time

It's true! This cable outperforms the original! When I charge my phone, it's chargier
 The data is more datery and the phone is more phoney in general
 If I wear the cable around my neck like a bolo tie, people like me better and I can run faster and jump higher
  If I circle my dinner plate with it, the food tastes better
 Basically this cable makes everything better than the original
 I'm thinking about getting a 2nd one!
This is clearly not a HTC cable as it has the Blackberry logo on it and the bulk packaging label says Blackberry


but it's a OEM micro usb cable none the less and works perfectly on any micro usb device I plugged it into
While I haven't tested it's speed against other cables I doubt it outperforms any other OEM cable but it works and that's all I asked for of it
The cable is a bit thick and as a result is stiff but not unmanageably so
It should also be noted that the cable shown in the picture is not of the actual product, that is a mini usb cable and appears to be quite a bit longer than the product, this cable is 1m long

"This cable not recommended for this device
" That is what I get for an error message
 Plus it is really short

I only trust HTC accessories for HTC phones having bad luck with aftermarket products that are cheaper, but cheap is expensive

I'll never understand how one review can say this item works exactly as it should and how the next complains about it not working


for the EXACT same phone! I just don't get it
 I decided to try it out despite the people that said it didn't work, and I'm glad I did
 It's exactly what I expected and wanted
 I actually bought 2 of these so I could leave one in my car and one at work
 For only $4 and some change for the both


this was a GREAT buy for me and now I never have to worry about my Incredible running out of battery!
I was really impressed by the price and was very excited when it arrived
 But it doesn't work like it says it does
 At first it charged my phone just fine but then it stopped charging; I waited a day to charge again but it still didn't charge

well bought this so i could have a spare cord since i have the original cord in my car with a usb charger there got tired of keeping track where i had it last
  so this cord works on when plugged into the wall
  when hooked to a pc phone wont stay connected to the pc to transfer files or anything
  so if you just need a cord to plug into the wall this will work but don't even think of this cord if you want to use it with a pc

I use this cord to charge my phone in my pc at work and it works great
 Doesn't charge super fast but charges it none the less

this product is great value for the price
 and it works like it suppose to
 you can't beat it
 you always need extra cords

poor manufacturing quality the connector is too long and does not properly fit in my phone
 I would not buy this

cable works fine with my verizon Galaxy S4, it charges and transmit the data fine
However, connector tip(phone side) is too thick, it won't fit if you use aftermarket cases

It is what it is
 A charging and sync cord
 It charges the phone and helps transfer data from the phone to the computer

The cable is good, but it does not fit the Samsung Galaxy S4
 It does plug in, but not far enough in to hold securely

It works and is a good value for the price compared to the retail stores
 The only negative is that it is just a tad too short

works great
 it is always good to have backup cables and this one works great and replaced my old one

I have purchased many chargers for my Samsung phone on amazon and honestly the quality is just so so on them
  Maybe I'm just really hard on chargers but I feel like they should last more than a few months
  Spend the money and get a good quality one

I got this to charge my Samsung Galaxy S2 but it ALWAYS came unplugged from the phone, whenever the phone would be moved it falls out and even just resting on a flat surface it would eventually find its way out of the phone
 I had to buy another USB cord because I became very frustrated with this
Purchased this USB cable to connect my Samsung smartphone to my laptop computer
  Works well and fits my needs and expectations

it works great and came at the right time you can never have enough chargers for every where lol thanks
These were really inexpensive and they work just like I wanted them to
There have been no problems so far
It was what I expected to be and works fine, thought it might have been a larger gauge of wire?
do you need to charge your phone? so you need to transfer data? then boy oh boy this cable does that

Works fine IF you don't move the phone
  If you handle the phone, the plug works its way out within two or three minutes
  This despite a relatively stiff fit
  Note that the cord that came with the phone plugs in smoothly and securely
  That's my general-use cord now; this one is relegated to overnight charging where the phone isn't being used

Disappointed at how cheap they are and doubt they were designed for newer devices
  They are also very short
  Took a long time to ship
  Specifically purchased due to the ad saying they were for Samsung Galaxy devices
  It did not work in my S4
  They require a good charger a d one that is newer and better

damaged charger
 when i recieved it the charger had a short in it
 i had to wiggle the cord for my phone to charge

It Works perfect
 It charges my phone pretty quickly and it's great that it retracts
 No problems with this charger

This is an excellent divice, I have order several within 6 months for family and friends who wanted to take mine
 Love it!
This charger doesn't work very well
 When plugged in, it shows that it is charging, but after ten minutes I'm lucky to get 1% more on my battery
 I only use it now if my battery is low and I want to keep it from getting lower


that's really all it's good for

I was pretty upset to find that one day it stopped charging my phone, right in the middle of a long trip
 FFFFFFUUUUUUU



I really like this charger and not having the cord hanging around all the time when it's not necessary
  Item was received quickly and was as seller stated
 The cord retracts in a snap when I'm done with it
 It also pulls out to whatever length so that I can just pull it out a short way to plug my phone in and the cord is not everywhere
 I recommend it!
It works, that's about all that can be said for it
 It charges my Galaxy fine, but cord does not retract
 Mine came with a busted spring
 Cheap enough I don't care, not worth the shipping to return
 It charges, I suppose that's all that matters
Looking at the price, I ordered 2 of these
It served the purpose initially
 But in few months one of them stopped working
that's 50% hit rate
 Though, I don't what's the life for the other charger

Initially it is a great charger at a great price
 However, I've been through 2 now and they tend to not last very long
 For the price though I guess it's still not a bad deal

love it for moving from car to car
  great for a mobile person
 can pack in brief case or backpack when travel, without worry about cord hanging or wrapping

The charger works fine
  It was a great value considering how much they cost in stores
  However, it doesn't retract at all

The plug fits and it charges my Captivate, it felt rather snug
 The "retractable"-ness of this charger is anything but
 Plain ol' doesn't work
 I literally took it out of the package, and the first time I pulled the cord out - didn't yank, tug, or otherwise forcefully pull it - about 10 inches and hit the retract button to test it out and it retracted about 2 inches of it
 I pulled it out further, retracted about 4 or so inches of it
 Bottom line was that after messing with it and *feeding* it back into the charger versus it retracting itself automatically when depressing the retract button, it took a few minutes to get the plug retracted so that only a few inches of cable was still hanging out of the charger and that was the best I could get
 The cable would only automatically retract 2-4 inches at any given length
 The main reason I wanted this was for the "retractability" since I hate having cables dangling around
Working on getting a refund for this item now

I've used this for almost 2 years now and it JUST NOW broke
 But I can still used it
 The button that retracts it just got loose so it doesn't latch anymore

took longer than expected to be delivered but over all satisfied with the charger
 the retractable cord is just long enough to reach the cup holder in my truck where i usually put my phone
 down side, ive already got 2 welps on my arm from retracting the cord! be careful! haha

was somewhat concerned after reading some of the reviews
 Price was great so I bought extras just in case
 Quality seems great
 Cord not quite as flimsy as expected from other comments
 Love not having the cords getting tangled in car
I love the retractable feature as it hides away so nicely
 I does the job just as well as a thick corded device
 excellent product

This works just fine to recharge my Captivate
 With some products, it's impossible to get a good tight connection to the phone at the USB end; this one does not have that problem

Item shipped and arrived very fast
 Item is perfect for my car & phone, very compact
 Item is as advertise

Great I gave it to my GF and she loves it

Not much to say, here
  This little charger works well and it was a lot less expensive than Sprint store

I like how long the cord is with this changer so that I'm able to reach the night stand and table from where I plug it in at
  However, I'm not a fan of how long it seems to take to charge to full charge, nor how it atomically &#34;stops&#34; charging at certain times on it's own

This is a very good charger to keep for travel and as a back up in your house
 I use it frequently

I was very pleased with this item when I got it back so quickly because it was a gift
 However, I cannot give a 5 star rating for a product that never worked

The Phone charger works, it charges the phone
 However, while the phone is charging it continually beeps as when the battery is too low
It will not stop beeping while it is charging until the battery reaches a certain percentage
I do not think this is the correct charger to be using on the phone I have
Now I am worried based on other reviewers that the battery may blow on the phone and I'll have to replace that too
I would not recommend buying this charger
The charger from my old blackberry works better

I had to replace the cord from the first one I purchased a month ago, but this one is great

It works great
 It has a longer cord than the one I got with the phone
 I would recommend this item

When i went to take the charger out of my wallit snapped in half
 Lesson learned,cheap things break too quickly

This power cord is a great replacement for the standard dual use cord that comes with your phone
 By dual use, I mean, the standard cord that comes with your phone is a usb data cable with a dc power plug on the end
 Sometimes I am using the phone and just one twist or tug of the line and the cable will disconnect from the dc power supply, which I imagine will cause the data cable to short out over time and also may ruin the battery
 Phone companies just got cheap and decided to stop sending phones with a power cable AND a data cable separately, but in the end, you will go out and get yourself a standard power cable


like this one, which is just fine


quality-wise and price-wise
 Yep
 Oh, and this does have a big red light that comes on once you plug it into the wall, whether your phone is plugged to it or not, so if you are one of those nit picky sleepers that needs a completely dark room to sleep, you stick yourself a small piece of black electrical tape over the light, because it is brighter then you may think

we've had it a month and it's working great
 wish the cord was a little longer but it's much longer than the one you get with the phone

it works and it works well
 i go through chargers pretty quickly so im hoping this one will hold up
 so far, so good! the wire is thick and its well put together! as far as im concerned, its well worth the small amount
Thanks for the quick delivery time
 And, it actually is a quality note pad! Mom loves it, it was a replacement gift for another brand from another company that did not work, this one is awesome!
I love that this has a longer cord!  It fits great in my phone!  Very pleased you have it so cheap!  Thanks!
Paid $0
32 for the charger and $2
81 Shipping & Handling




Yeah, I know the shipping & handling was much more expensive than the charger was but I needed a charger that connected and this one fit nice and snug so I am able to charge my phone while sitting at my desk in my home office at my computer looking for work




which is an all day job huh?  LOL!  Wow, I wish I could write reviews for a living wouldn't that be nice?  I think the total price of $$3
13 was a great savings compared to how much the retailers that sell the mobile phones charge anywhere from $10-$20
  Ms_Thrifty has done it again!  Stay tune to more reviews, Oh how I love Amazon!
Gave this 4 of 5 stars because the cord is waaaaaaay too short
 Works well
 Charges phone quickly also
 Wouldn't buy again however

Its a charger and it works as advertised
 It also cam in the mail pretty quickly so I am satasfied with that as well

U can never have too many
  Bought this as a spare for purse, home and work
  Now I don't have to worry about forgetting it

Product came really fast, nice long cord, which was great considering factory cord is so short
 Worked great til the third day, then I don't know what happened


at the price I didn't expect perfection, and at Sellers defense,I have not contacted them

it could easily be my own fault and I've been so busy


even review is late
 (Sorry)
Have this in my office at work for a little extra boost when needed
 Nothing fancy just a charger that does what its ment to do

Bought as gift for my relative and he loves it




Great job


Would highly recommend this product to all customers
Thank you
Where you mainly use your blue tooth is when you need to be hands on the wheel


driving
If your BT is down on battery charge, this is handy
  I just wish the length of the cord were longer



I already had a plug-in in the charger nearest me



!
I have used this car charger for the last 2 months
 So far all is well
 Nice retractable cord
 It retracts at the push of a button

it was the wrong one
The male end does not fit the Iphone 4s 
  Once it was pulled out it would not retract
I have not used this as of yet , however, my wife has without issue
I have the x50 headset and she has the voyage, it works on both really well

THIS IS A BAD CHARGER IT DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY AND IT HAS A REALLY BAD SHORTAGE
 I HATE IT!
works great for powering my Plantronics BT
 i like the retractable cord so it doesnt have a long cord getting in the way
 nice and compact and easy to store when not in use
good
I was a bit wary about buying this headset in used condition, but was lured by the half-price price tag when compared to a new headset
 I envisioned all sorts of shortcomings, but when it arrived I was astounded at the excellent condition of the headset
 It is clean
 No scratches
 No faded labeling
 It looked to be brand new
 Oh yeah


it works great, too
&#128077;
I love that this headset stays firmly on the head with the band and firmly on the ear with just the ear piece
  The sound quality is great, and the ability to mute the mic is the main reason I bought this
  The mute switch is in a convenient place and has a nice clip to attach to your shirt
  The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have had a lot of people tell me I sound somewhat distorted when talking on it
  Usually I can make it better by adjusting the mic volume (another nice feature) or by moving the mic away from my mouth
  Overall good purchase for the money

I've been using one of these for years!  I replace it with a new one when the old one wears out
  The mic is always strong enough to pick up my voice, and I never have complaints about people not being able to hear me
  The ear-pad is comfy, and I occasionally forget I have this on
  The best part is the adjustable amplifier - if I have distortion from the sound out of my cell phone, I can increase or decrease both the output from the cell phone itself and the amplifier on the headset, and I usually can maximize the sound and minimize distortion
  I don't have to hold anything with my hand to get the conversation through

Love this type of headset
  I use one at work every day, so I got one for home too
  I hate things &#34;in&#34; my ear, so this quality over-the-head type keeps everything where it belongs and I can wear it for hours with no pain or irritation
  Comfortable and lightweight
  Doesn't even mess up hair
  It includes a leatherette &#34;cup&#34; for the ear speaker, but I usually don't even use it, finding it comfortable even without it
  It converts to an &#34;ear hook&#34; type also, but I don't find that very useful
  The inline volume control and mute is nice, although a bit large and heavy
  Great sound quality
This headset works fine, but I expected somewhat better sound quality for the price
 Also have not been able to get it to work with my Samsung Galaxy, I'm guess that was an issue with the 2
5 to 3
5 mm plug adapter I got since it works fine with my panasonic cordless phone
 Not sure if this would allow you to initiate a call on the cell phone, however, which is what I am really looking for from a headset since bluetooth headset sound quality is so poor

I bought this for its durability, but the sound quality was pretty low/poor; volume was low too

This is a decent quality headset and sound quality from the ear piece is standard Plantronics quality (i
e
 very good)
 The 2
5mm jack means it won't fit on some mobile phones (this is smaller than a standard headphone jack), but for my Blackberry it's great (both 8820 and Pearl)
 As a bonus, I also use it with my XBOX 360 controllers (both with the attached messenger keyboard and without) for online gaming
 Some people have observed that I sound a little distant with this headset while plugged into the wireless XBOX controller, but repositioning the mic to be as close to my mouth as possible fixes it
There is an adjustable mic sensitivity switch on the plug, but this doesn't seem to make any difference to people at the far end of the conversation
It's held up quite well over the past few years, being stuffed in bags and traveling around
 It's not as cool as the wireless headsets (bluetooth etc) but it doesn't take batteries, doesn't have to be recharged and isn't subject to interference
 I'll buy it again if/when this one finally dies

I love the product even though I messed up and didn't know I needed a 3
5 so had to purchase adaptor
  I had a small issue that was my own fault and this company was outstanding with customer service

Excited about this based on good reviews, but did not have the same experience
Tested on my Nexus S cell phone, person on the other end complained about static and poor quality sound
  I unplugged headset and switched to using my cell, and they said the problem went away, so unfortunately problem seems to be with this headset
Also, just FYI, this does not come retail packaged, but shows up in a plastic bag with no instructions
  Not a problem for me, but makes me wonder where these are from and the quality

These have great sound and my voice is clear to other parties
 The volume switch and mute slider work well and it has lasted for some time

I've been buying these headsets for several years, recommending them to friends and associates and now I'm buying them as gifts for the headset challenged
 You know, people who literally have pains in their neck from clamping a phone between their head and shoulders
These are wonderful headsets
 I've used them with a variety of cordless and cell phones
 As long as you have a 2
5mm socket, you're in business
 Audio reception is excellent even for those like me with moderate hearing loss
 And the microphones are simply top-notch
I've had only one break and that was because I crammed it into a travel case - and I mean crammed
 With regard to ordinary daily abuse, these hold up well
All in all, an excellent value
Jerry
I've tried and returned at least 5 headsets ranging from $15 to $150
 This one was typical of the others that I returned, low volume on the earpiece and low quality microphone
 I finally ended up with a Panasonic TCA60 for about $19 which is very loud and sounds great on both ends
 It's nothing fancy, no volume control and no mute, but who needs that when you can accomplish the same thing with your phone
 Price does not determine sound quality
 I recommend this product

A nice change for me - having a headset that doesn't slip and slide, fall out of my ear, or buzz
 My favorite feature is the button that controls the sound level the recipient of my call experiences
 The only time is doesn't work well is when the listener is also wearing a headset, and even then, I suspect that it is the fault of the listener's headset and not mine

The only problem with this headset is that people you are talking to will have trouble hearing you
  This is pretty important to me, so I only give it 2 stars
  I have used it extensively with both my cell phone and my cordless phones at home with the same problem

I don't think this will last very long
  I was thinking of deploying this in a call center environment, but I don't think it would last very long
  Plus, the cord is too short for desktop use

Before buying this set I searched a lot and did read a lot of reviews and finally I chose to go with this set
 The screwdrivers are very easy to use specially with iphones
I had to change the batterry on my iphone and if Stanley screwdriver set was not there I was about to break my iphone
Thanks for making this set so helpful and easy to use

Handy little set to have around if you tinker with electronic devices
 This set has many uses for otherthings also
 Product is as described and price is right
 I recommend everyone having a set

I bought this set to fix a pair of eyeglasses that had loose screws
 The smallest screwdriver in this kit was perfect for that job, so mission accomplished
 The tops of each screwdriver twirls independently from the shaft, meaning you can keep a finger on top of the head to stabilize the driver while you're screwing
 (Sorry, there's no other way to say that
) The box suggests these screwdrivers can be used for repairing eyeglasses, cameras, watches, fishing reels, hobbies, electronics, and small appliances
 I think this set will come in very handy

Screwdrivers work well, however plastic separator tool tip broke off on the first phone case I used it to open


what a drag

I like them but they are not super duty materials
 Works great for the application but when I was dismantling a hard drive one of them stripped
  Im not too concerned because of the price
 Over all good value!
The one plastic wedge broke on first use
  Otherwise, it is about what I expected
  A usable set of tools for phones and some laptops

The Torx screw drivers work wonderfully and the tweezers work well, but the pry tool is too weak and ineffectual for the project I used them on
I bought this kit to remove the cameras out of my HTC 4G LTE and I didn't have any problems except for removing the small plastic portion on the bottom rear side of the phone
  The pry tool was way too flimsy for the job and I'm not convinced that it would do the trick for any similar function
I'd recommend this kit if you primarily purchased it for the Torx drivers but not if you require the use of the pry tool as well

This comes with 4 flats and 2 philips
 I believe they are also metric in sizes
 I used one to take a part a netbook
 I like the fact that they spin, come in a plastic kit
 They are reasonably priced
 These items are high quality
 Handles are small and can be hard to loosen a screw if torqued down
 I used them for a laptop not as a jeweler so


 Nice case, nice color, small area, 


 Comes in a card board cover as well
 Packaged and more packaged
 A little over doing it there
 Can't be at times a little difficult to open the plastic case
 Was going push up or down
 Comes with different sizes
 Some of the flats seemed a little thick in the blade
 Not a bad item for the price
 Always good to have a set of these around for glasses/sunglasses or for other items with small screws

I had to replace the battery on my phone cause it had gone completely flat
 Apple was charging a lot and this battery did the job perfectly for a lot cheaper and came with the tools

Installation was easy and the tool kit worked though the plastic tools are no the robust and will break if you tweak on them too much
 The paper foil was coming off the battery when I open the package but folding back in place worked, once it's in the phone it is not an issue
 So far the phone charges fast and the life is much better than the 2 year old battery it replaced
 So far I would recommend this battery
Update: 4 weeks after installing this battery is would only last 5 hours and that was barely using the iPhone with NO voice calls at all during that time and no extra heavy use of the internet or anything
 Drained it and charged from dead several times, made sure that location services, blue tooth, apps closed


 all OFF and still drained
 Got my money back and bought one for 1/2 the price and that one works great! Maybe I just got a defective battery



 A risk we all take when buying these 3rd party batteries

plastic pry tool kinda sucks, but all the other tools in the kit are quite handy, helped me fix a broken screen on a $500 phone so saved a bit of cheddar there

The tools helped greatly
 I used the tools it provided and followed the instruction video on Youtube
 Everything was done in about 30mins, for a beginner like me
 The battery, which replaced my 2-year old original one, works well so far after about one and half months
 It gets charged very quickly and lasted very long
 For average user like me, the battery last for about 10 + hours every full charge

Wish it was magnetized but it's sturdy & has the common pieces I need when I'm working on smaller items or electronics
 Seems sturdy though only time will tell

bought tool kit to do a battery upgrade on my cell phone
 since it has an embedded battery I needed to take the phone apart
 like the saying goes when you got the right tools things go a lot easier most of the time

Used this in a phone I repaired, battery fit perfectly and seemed to work fine, phone was on 5 percent, left it for two days, then I checked and it was on 1%, seems legit

I haven't used them all yet, but they aren't as quality as some of my precision tools
  Like the pry tool and tweezers

I must agree with Gary Tuscon's review
 For under $5, even though the smallest flat-head screwdriver in here is 1
4 mm (too large for the screws that hold the links on a Seiko women's watchband), the quality is such that I will keep them
 The case is very good and labeled very clearly
 The screwdrivers have a decent weight as well and the handles turn smoothy
If these came in smaller sizes, with tempered tips that smaller sized tools need to be strong, I would definitely consider them as well
If I had one minor nitpick, it would be that a color-coding of the handles would be a great help, but really, this is an excellent value for the price

These tools gets the job done
 Had no problem I was able to finish less than a hour going to also buy two more for my friends
 great deal and quality product quick and fast Thanks!!
Very pleased with this tool kit
  I have already gotten a couple phones repaired with this kit with no loss anywhere in the kit
  Would purchase again if necessary

This set has some very unique screw driver  heads, the kind of set you need for working on cell phones or household small appliances
 You would have a hard time finding some of them

the torx is the only real useful tool in here for the evo4g
 not a big fan, just use a credit card instead
Seem to be high quality compare with the cost
 Have every thing I needed (or more) to open my Motorola Droid

I should've ordered at least two sets
  These come in handy for a lot of things, home, workplace, etc
  And as soon as others know you have them, they need to &#34;borrow&#34;
  Keep you eye on them!  Great tool for a lot of little projects
  Fair price

These tools are better than expected
 The handles are hard plastic but fit my hand nicely and the the rotating tops work well
 The tweezer ends match perfectly so they pick up small parts with ease
 Similarly, the driver tips are well machined and accurately sized
 Only the plastic prying tool seems a bit flimsy, but it nevertheless held up to some hard prying without breaking
 In all, a good deal and I'm ordering a second set this evening

Needed for my Razr cellphone to change the internal battery
  More tiny screwdrivers than I'll ever use but are of good quality for what I needed

Seeing is how the 2, 5 star reviews on this item are from fake users who seem to be trash talking other iphone battery sellers and 5 staring there own is pretty messed up so therefore it appears this seller is some type of scammer

After viewing some youtube videos on this procedure, I was able to swap the battery in about 1/2 hour (which included taking pictures and studying the insides of the iPhone 4S
The tools are good enough to get the job done -- I never felt that the tools were going to fall apart
  In fact, I'm keeping them around for other mobile phone work
The only thing I'd recommend (esp
 for older folks with not-so-good eyesight) is a good way to magnify things so you can see what you're doing
  I use a big magnifying glass, 1
5x reading glasses (3x would be better), a headlamp (to add light where I need it)

Pros- Good tool set if you need to take things apart
Cons- They came in a plastic bag (no case)- They're extremely flimsy plastic that makes me feel like if I use them over 10 times, they're going to break
I don't recommend this at all and would recommend you buy something other than this

Judging from what I've seen in other reviews and what I received there is inconsistency in what is being shipped out
  I received a zip-lock bag containing 12 pieces
 (See user uploaded photo that matches the description below)- 6 Torx type drivers, magnetic tip (T4,T5,T6,T7,T8,T10) (Orange handle, with blue cap)- 1 Philips driver, magnetic tip (black handle)- 1 Flat driver, magnetic tip (black handle)- 1 3-point driver, magnetic tip (clear red handle)- 2 tweezers (stainless steel, on blister packs)- 1 pry tool (dark green)I purchased this set to do some work on a Droid X (MB810), and they did the job well enough, except I had to carefully use the T4 instead of a T3 *very* carefully on 12 screws holding the screen assembly together
 I'll give it a 3 star rating "It's OK"
Battery would not charge in iPhone
 iPhone shut down after 2 minutes of being powered up
 Had to throw it away

i bought these tool to us for repairing my nephews iphone 4 but non of them were the right size, so if you buying them for the iPhone don't buy these
Does not fit the 4s so make sure you are ordering the right one
  You will need tools, so I suggest you get one with tools

I had to pop open my Samsung Galaxy S3 to fix it up but none of the tools I had worked or fit
 These worked perfectly and fit the screws and took it apart with ease
 Compact and easy to carry around
It arrived on time and in good shape
 Thanks!
worked great
I use these for electronics repairs
  There are several sizes and configurations to meet various needs
  The most helpful thing about them is the independently turning barrel which allows you to apply pressure on the end of the tool and easily turn the barrel/screw right or left
  They may not be the best tools on the market, but they have served me well

These are all torx drivers, there is no flathead or phillips in this set, which is going back to Amazon today

Nothing too special over here
  Just some screwdrivers
  Seem to hold up well
  I used them on my g-shock band, and they worked and didn't strip, so I was pleased

I got this to try and replace a screen, found out I'm not a phone repair person
  It did have what I needed, lacking skill needed to do the job
  I can replace my hard drive in my home computer, and add memory, this takes allot more skill
  If you have the skill, the tools are great and very complete
  I had everything the video said I needed, minus the skill

very helpful and good quality
I rate this 5 stars
 Love this product! great price and quality
 Love how it works with my iphone 4
 And it comes with a lot of tools which is great, in case you misplace one of them

It has a lot of what I need to do basic repairs on a phone but it is bare bones

Could have been better for the price and wait time
 2 of the drivers are labeled as a 1
5 but are clearly different sizes
 Also the wear kinda fast if working with tight screws
Very fast delivery
  product is as described and useful tool
  If  you need a set of these this is a good one
I use these mostly for electronics repair and they get they job done
 Great for phone repair or and small electronics

I watched a short video on you tube then ordered this kit
  I changed the battery in just a few minutes
  Amazingly simple
  All the tools you need are here (the star screw driver is the only thing thats not really standard, but here its all in one place)
  Just do it

You may not need these types of screwdrivers often, but when you do need them, nothing else will do
  They're great for tightening eyeglass screws or opening up the cases of small electronic devices
This is a nice set
  It comes with 4 slotted and 2 philips style in a variety of sizes
 They seem to be well made and I suspect that they last a long time
 The swivel heads allow you to put downward pressure on the screwdriver as you turn it to minimize the risk of stripping the head on delicate small screws
 The case has a labeled space for each screwdriver
 It's your typical plastic case with a snap top and should hold up as long as you don't step on it or drop something on it
  This set is a nice value for the price

It is chinesse(like almost everything in this world LOL) but they are really well done, and for the price they are a bargain
The screw drivers have a free rolling top to make pressure, and the body is rellay good, nice grip and 3 lobules ergonomics
The pliers are just as good as you can get, no problems with them and good finish on the edges, not like razors like othersthe prying tool is just what you need for almost any device you want to tear apart(besides the iPad) they have enough strenght to pry out plastics and even aluminun bodys of smartphones
There is to mini screwdriver, a flat an a phillips, I use them for electronics
Overall pretty satisfied, I would buy another one later on
Really poor quality tweezer bent like nothing screw drivers made of cheap plastic adhesive removing tool again cheap plastic you get what you pay for would not recommend to anyone who is trying to perform phone surgery
Not the best ive purchased but it came with the right size for iphone 4 but the ones with the yellow handles are really just different sizes for a star screw, and none of them fits the iphone 4 star screw
 You can always use it for another gadget though

Once or twice a month you need a smaller screwdriver than your always handy six -in-one
 This setfills the bill nicely
 When you need it you need it
 A must have

this item came in a timely matter and fit the descrition the only thing that the plastic broke a little to easily but other than that every thing else is good
Nothing fancy but is extremely useful when you need it! love the tweezers and the big writing telling me which tool is which size
 Took a while, 3-4 weeks i'd guess, but was worth the wait! I'd easily recommend them

I received it today and it doesn't charge
 I'm sure it is used - I found a piece of broken iPhone glass on the contact side

Like others have said here, the screwdriver set is solid and good quality and will last forever
  The issue of course here is that the screwdrivers are not a true jewelers set and will be too big for most jewelry/watch related tasks
  So if you are looking for that type of set, this isnt the one to use

It's $6 so I don't know if I'm asking too much
 The screw drivers work and are slightly magnetized
 The prying tool is completely junk and broke before I had even finished my task - a guitar pick is much more durable
 The tweezers are also worthless
 Get them for the screwdrivers, not for the other tools

I needed a new screwdriver set to work on laptops with, as most of my old ones have mysteriously disappeared
 At the price, there was no way I was going to beat a set of Stanleys
 The best part so far, to me, is that they come already magnetized
 I put them to use the day I received them, and am quite happy with them

I purchased this battery to replace a water soaked one in an iPhone 4
 I don't even know if it is charging or not as the unit won't turn on for me
 The shipping is prompt, the packaging great, and the description is accurate

now I have it
 I can carry it with me and always have the perfect size tool for the little things that go wrong

i have used this kit to fix a bunch of cell phones  and price is right and tools work great
I'm sure that there is something that says it will not come as pictured, but still I was disappointed
The tools helped me get the job done, but they also did not hold up well
 The plastic plying tools bent and broke fairly quickly
 I can't say that it wasn't user error, but they seemed very cheap

I bought this for my wife's 2 year old iphone 4S
  She said it seemed to work about the same or a little better than the old battery
  Not a huge improvement, but an acceptable replacement  if you need a new battery

This review is for the iPhone 5 battery and tool set
 I realize now that the company is selling several different items under the same listing, so the reviews can be confusing and not accurate
Like many other &#34;power users&#34; (i
e
 slaves) of their iPhones, I came to the end of the usefulness for my iPhone 5's internal battery
 After lamenting on whether or not to buy some of the cheaper options available, I went with the &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; cliche and paid for the extra assurance that I was not getting a cheap knockoff
The battery I received had a manufacturer date only a few months from when I ordered the piece
 Who knows how accurate that is, but if you're taking it at face value, I find certain comfort knowing that my battery hasn't been sitting on the shelf losing it's potential usefulness in holding a charge for my crushing of candies
After successfully opening my phone, I can confirm that all the labeling and signage match exactly to what is on the original battery in my phone
 Any copycat can do this, but it gives me hope that this new battery comes from the same manufacturers as the OEM battery
The tools worked just fine for me
 I was able to pry the top glass of my phone off by using the tools provided in the kit
 Do some extra research around properly removing the battery
 Use the clear plastic sheet under the battery to help lift it up and separate from the adhesive
 That was the most challenging part of my battery replacement
 After two months of use, I can make it through the whole day after heavy phone use without looking for a charger
 My life is complete again!
This is a good buy if it is what you are wanting
  I misread the product info and did not realize this is all Torx screwdrivers

This was a great deal
  Easy to install and a direct fit replacement for the iPhone 4s
  Does what it should and hopefully it will last

I fix my own phones and Tab 3 and Mac computers (desk top and laptop), and IPad(s)
 So having the right tools are very important to me
 The price was the thing that did it for me
 Great price!!
Purchased this to remove screws on my Samsung Galaxy SII but even the smallest tool in the set was too large

I bought this set and have repaired my android a few times already and it's a must have tool set when working on such small electronics
Great tools, I still use them and I like the quality, great price as well
Good vendor
I would buy more

This tool set is better than expected
 The machining and finish is very good
 If used for small electronics and similar applications, this set should be durable

not bad,but Too little things inside is incomplete, and the bad use of hexagonal
 But it is ok 
 thanks
This was a great deal for the set
 High quality materials at a low price
 I would recommend this product to a friend

Tools were required for opening GPS, iPOD, etc cases
 Nice selection of sizes
 The plastic wedge tool is easily damaged
 A five star rating if it included a case (I would have even paid extra for a case)
the Torx screwdrivers were great, the tweesers were substandard, and the spluger was very cheap, mine broke the first time i used it
  For the price you cannot expect high quality
  all in all it did the job
These were a supper price and while not supper strong they will do the job and you get a lot for your money

For the price, you cannot beat this little Stanley screwdriver set
  This one features several very tiny standard and Phillips head screwdrivers
  If you have a need for very small head screwdrivers, this one is for you
  These are useful for messing with eyeglasses, certain electronics gadgets, and firearms
  I have several revolvers and pistols which have sight adjustments that have outrageously small adjustment screws
  For these sights this little kit is a must -- none of my other tools could manage to fit these screws but this one did
  That alone made it worth the Amazon price and this little kit has a permanent place in my range shooting bag
  RJB

This tool repair kit is useful for repairs on a laptop, smartphone, eyeglasses, and anything else with very small screws

Had a mix up with getting the item and slow shipping but it was all resolved in the end so I am satisfied with the purchase
I really needed the torx driver tools to fix broken Nexus 4 back plate and this kit worked great
 I'm really glad to have it around in case I need it again

i ordered this to replace my iphone battery, i am a deployed soldier and now i have become the cell phone technition
The battery worked very well! I used the screwdriver and the plastic pieces of the kit in replacement, and the tips of the spudger get bent without hard use - such as prying the old battery out
 Still, a great value in a DIY kit to give new life to your tired iPhone 4S!
I tried two (yes, two) batteries and had to send both back because both were crap
 I finally decided to spend a bit more hoping it would equate to more quality
 Well that seems to have paid off (third time's the charm I guess)
 The battery itself replaced my old battery perfectly
 It holds a charge well and reads the correct battery percentage
 The included tools were a bonus
 I already had a set of tools from replacing my wife's battery a while back
 However these were much better
 The old tools I had were stripping the tiny screw heads
 This set of tools gripped the screw heads perfectly
 Overall I'm very happy

very handy tools i mostly use it when i have to fix soomething small like phones docks and other cool stuff
very nice quality set of screwdrivers
 they sell bigger sets on here for cheaper, but made by a different company
 DO NOT BUY THEM
 if you want a quality precision set of drivers
 this is the company to go with

the tools are ok Just not quite what I  expected
  They were, however, better than the ones that came with the screen I ordered

Got this to replace an iphone5 battery that was only useable when it was tethered
 Now it holds full charge and is ready to go
 Great OEM repalcement
 The tools are nice enough to use again too

You get what you pay for
 They strip easily
 VERY cheaply made
 But I only needed them for a one time use and I didn't have to spend a bunch of money so I can't really complain
 But if you will need them more than once


spend the money on good tools

I have never bought an actual set in a box before
  Over the years I have just cobbled together an odd assortment of small screwdrivers
  This was well rated, inexpensive, and in a case
  It is all that I expected
  It works for me

Good but if you plan to repair or take apart apple products this kit is completely useless and won't be worth it
Was about ready to send my Jawbone Era back
 Then I ordered the Jabra ear gels
 Now I can wear my Jawbone all day! Aliph should include these with the Jawbone headsets
 And I intend to tell them! Jawbone Era is awesome too!
I bought these eargels for my bluetooth, which happens to be a Samsung WEP200, and it fit it perfectly
 Gives great comfort and a perfect fit
 Comes with more than just three
 Comes with a whole bunch
 Highly recommended product
I bought these to use with my Jawbone Era bluetooth headset
  The Era comes with 9 different options for ear inserts
  But I always felt like the earpiece was about to fall out, unless I jammed it into my ear so far that it became uncomfortable
Enter the Jabra EarGels


  These made a huge difference
  It fit perfectly onto my ear (the nub on the top goes into the spot above the ear hole)
  I could wear this all day
  I wouldn't wear these eargels without having an over-the-ear hook attachment on my Era, but these have made a huge difference for the comfort of my bluetooth earpiece

The eargels fit to the earpiece is fine, nice and tight, but as far as actually getting ANY of the sizes to comfortably fit, FORGET IT
I got these for my jawbone headset
 Many had said they work great
 but for the life of me i cant figure out how you get them to work short of superglue and even then they are too quiet to hear so i guess they work on the jabra they are designed for but not the jawbone

On the recommendations of a few reviewers, I tried these gels for my Jawbone headset
 Unfortunately, they did not fit well and came off every time I took the headset off
 That was too bad because they did seem somewhat comfortable and did direct the sound into my ear for a louder and clearer sound
 However, I returned them because of the poor fit
 They would probably work well on some other headsets
 If they fit your headset then I would give these gels a try

When I first installed one of these on my new Jawbone II, they were fantastic
  They fit my ear canal perfectly, negating the need for the ear loop that came with it
  Unfotunately after a few days they started rejecting my headset
  The ear pieces would not stay on the Jawbone, and they would no longer stay firmly in my ear
  I tried washing and drying them thoroughly, but that only helped for an hour or so
  I am not sure what the fit problem is, but they turned out to not work for my Jawbone II and me at all

these were advertised to fit the habra stone
  they did not
 i don't know if they changed the advertisement since then but it was aid to be a package with the habra stone so i got it
 not even one piece fit
  threw them away
I bought these to redirect sound into the ear for my jawbone
 TO that end it worked like a champ
 the only issue I have is that after about a year they started to yellow
 I guess that is common with these clear jelly products though

The Jabra Eargels are wonderful

 I cannot believe how comfortable, and user friendly they are
  Thank you, if not for these, I could not use my bluetooth
Great Merchandise


I purchased these because the original ear pieces from jabra were OK but left me pushing on my headset constantly trying to get it in my ear more
  Which, unfortunately, resulted in a lot of accidental button pushing and disconnecting calls
I saw these on Amazon and thought they were worth trying
  I loved that you get basically 6 ear gels in 3 sizes for both right and left error
I found a size that fit my ear perfectly and was able to use the headset without the earband which was a surprise
The ear gels are gentle and fit in the ear
  Only reason I am giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is that it takes quite a bit of adjusting and finesse to get the gel on the headset
  Also, while I enjoyed the product I feel it may be slightly over priced for what you get
But overall a great product and the sound is now channelled directly into my ear so I don't have to keep pushing my headset in to hear
  I would recommend this product to others who find the jabra sound decent but also wish it would go in the ear a little more

people should buy headsets to fit these things bc they are so essential

A must have for any headset that will fit them
These Ear Gels Work Very Well, Comfort Is The Main Reason I Bought Them, Fit The Ear Very Well, The Price Was Right, You Will Not Go Wrong With These Ear Gels, That Is Why I Gave Them Five Stars
Works great on ear buds
 I bought these to put on my basic ear buds and have them fit more comfortable so I can wear them longer
 Great for wearing in the car during long drives

I bought these so my headset would be more comfortable


These hurt your ears just like the one that comes with it no matter what size you use
 I wouldn't recommend this to anyone


Don't waste your money

Purchased the Jawbone bluetooth headset
 It was just not comfortable, but with these all is great now
 Could not ask for a better set of earpieces
 Great use of my money to get these

These are the exact ones that I was looking for but there is one problem
  They are supposed to be clear but they arrived yellowed in the package
  It is obvious that they are new, but they have yellowed and are no longer clear
  I bought these to replace existing ones that I have that have yellowed but not to the extent of these new ones
  I have had the previous ones since 2010
  I will keep as spares but am unhappy with the condition of these EarGels

I like this Jabra earboom so much that I have purchased 6 of these so far
  And that is my biggest complaint, is their poor quality of workmanship
  They work well but just don't last
  Granted, I'm a road warrior and my earbooms probably go through more abuse than a casual user
  The reason I keep buying them is the audio quality is fantastic and the fit within my ear is solid
  I keep two spares on hand at all times so as soon as one fails I can throw it away and move on
  At this price, I can afford it
  Also, Jabra customer services is great
  I lost the windscreen for the boom mic once and an email to them got me a set of windscreens in my mailbox, no charge

The gel inserts on the Jabra is quite uncomfortable, at least for me
  It's a bit hard to make the earbud stay in my ear, and forget about jogging wearing this
  Also the insert comes off very easily, and if a friend wants to borrow it and has different size of ears, you need to find the other sizes of the insert
  Sound quality is mediocre, as callees often complain about wind noise from my end
  I'm not happy with these

Jabra makes, by far the best hands-free devices on the market
  This particular model, the EarBoom, is not with it's faults
  However, it will meet your needs for the most part if you figure out it's peculiarities
Jabra provides multiple ear gels for comfort and for left ear or right ear use
  The criticism that they are hard to get used to is valid
  You have to try putting them in different ways till you figure it out
  The instructions are not a substitute for trial and error I suppose
As for the hands-free jack on your phone, you have to make sure you have a 2
5 millimeter jack
  That is the one with 2 stripes on the plug
  Unfortunately, a specific compatibility list is hard to come by
  Look at the specs for your phone and give it a try
The microphone will capture sound just fine, despite the short arm
  If you find people are telling you your voice is muffled, you must slighly twist the microphone head
  I have found that sometimes, if it is at the wrong angle, it will not capture sound as well
  The arm is flexible enough that it can be adjusted slightly
I also prefer the EarWave Boom or the EarWrap, which have wraparound ear attachments and a slightly longer more solid arm
  The Jabra EarWave Bud doesn't have a microphone arm, but instead has the small mic on the cable with a clip to attach it to your tie
  Personally I don't like those models
  I have not found much difference in sound quality, though the EarWave Boom and the EarWrap are somehow easier to figure out
For difficulty of use and for a microphone arm style that I just don't like, I have docked this unit 2 stars
  It should be noted that none of Jabra's newer models have this microphone arm any longer  But this is good bang for the buck
  Try other higher end models if you are more demanding, like I am, and are willing to spend the money

these are the very best quality at a AWESOME price
Save $20
 over a cell phone company price

These things were terrible
  The &#34;Boom&#34; would keep pulling the ear but out of my ear and I couldn't keep anything in place
 The cord was very flimsy


 It was just an all around bad buy
  Wouldn't do it again

Yeah, I know, they warned me; but I thought I was smarter than the average bear- not so
If you have auto reverse on your tape player and you cannot shut the feature off, this will not work
  It may work for a few minutes at a time, but will always end up frustrating you by switching every few minutes
If you can turn off the auto reverse (or don't have it), it's a very solid product that sounded great
For those like me who need a FM transmitter instead of the tape version, I'd suggest the Soundkase FM Transmitter for iPod & MP3s
  We've been using it for a week or 2 with good results (and from my research, probably the best results you can get if you can't use a tape connection)

Good Item, BUT




The sound could be better


U get what u Pay For!!$8
00 for this as opposed to minimum $130 for a CHEAP CD installed in the dash
Well worth the couple of $$$
Not really worth getting
Except for very limited application this is not an good way to connect a audio device to the car stereo
this item creates a bunch of mechanical noise and in addition the sound quality from the attached device is very poor
 It works but is not worth listening to unless one has to
  As limited as the fm transmitters are they have significantly better sound quality
  I'd return this except it would cost more to ship than it is worth

My moms car couldn't have an upgraded radio (freaking saabs


) but one of the two positions didn't work
 Still worked for her though

Great for the price
  Sound quality is not what it should be, I think, but my kids love it
  I like the idea and am going to buy one for my car, but a different brand to see if there is a difference in sound

I was worried about having problems with the Auto Reverse, but it worked the very first time in my '05 Audi A4 with factory stereo
 The sound quality isn't CD level, but then again its better than my old FM transmitter

I tried using it with my Sansa Clip MP3 player in my Toyota MR2
 The car makes a lot of noise in any case, so I'm not holding out for audio lab quality
 However, the product made a quite audible (at low automobile speeds) click-click-click
 I might have been able to tolerate that
 However, there was also an electronic whistle increasing in frequency with the RPM of the engine
 The whistle interfered excessively with the intended sound from the player
 The volume of the Coby CA-747 was ok
 I hadn't thought that would be an issue until I bought a comparable Maxell cassette adapter at Long's to replace the Coby CA-747
 The volume with the Maxell product was very weak, and I had to turn it way up
 The Maxell didn't go click-click-click, but it whistled, too
 So both the Maxell and the Coby get 1 star from me
 I'm trying out the offering from Philips next



Purchased this to try out in the workplace
 Don't have access to a decent sound system, so wanted to be able to pipe some mp3s through the clunky boom boxes that are available, without having to lug around a CD case
 I was very pleased to find the sound quality is excellent
 Playing mp3s from a phone or player sounds more clear and louder than if I were to tune in a radio station
 This model had some of the best reviews on the site, and it appears to be a good unit so far
 I had to go with 5 stars because you can't beat the price for something that works this well
**Update** It has been about a couple of months so I thought I should add that this unit has worked out great so far
 It gets many hours of use and delivers very clean sound
 I couldn't be happier with this purchase

I have been using this Coby CA-747 Cassette Adapter for more than 2 years to use my car stereo to play audio of my DVD-player and CD-player
 Until lately, my car tape player kept rejecting it out
 I thought it was broken and I was about to buy this same product from Amaonz again
 While reading some other people's reviews, I bump into R
 Penny's feedback on 10/26/05 about the "skip" mode as following:"One thing to keep in mind when using any product like this - some (but not all) car tape players have a "skip" mode
 When a tape player's "skip" mode is active, it listens for silent portions of the tape
 If it is detects any silence for more than a few seconds, it will automatically go into fast forward until it "hears" sound again
 If your tape player has a "skip" mode, be sure to cancel this mode - i
e
, put the player in "normal" play mode
 Otherwise, you will find the tape player trying to "fast forward" over any silent portions of your audio feed
"This is exactly the problem that I was having
 By turning off the "skip" mode of the car tape player, my car tape player does not reject the Coby Cassette Adapter anymore
Again, even if it is indeed broken, I will buy the same product again
 Very good product for the money

I bought this cassette adapter to replace my old one who's cord got ripped in half when stuck in my door
 I get better sound out of this one than I did from my other one that I originally bought for more than twice the price
The best part of this cassette adapter is that the cord is coiled, and can be stretched to be super long (probably at least 8 feet although I have not checked) yet when no tension is applied (during normal use or storage) the cord is only about 3 feet long
 This keeps it from getting stuck in things like car doors or wrapped around steering wheels or getting all tangled which my old adapter did
I am very pleasantly surprised at this adapter
 I more than got my money's worth out of it

works great in my 2002 honda accord!  other adapters have either gimped the frequency range or only come out of one speaker

Just for kicks I did a "local order" at 2am Monday morning because it said the package would still arrive on Monday
 I didn't believe it, so I figured, "I'll pay for that and when it doesn't arrive on time I'll get my money back for the shipping cost" (I mean come on, it was 300 miles south of me!!)
  Only 12 hours later the package had come 300 miles onto my doorstep
  That my friends is dedication to one's time commitment
 Wow
As far as the product goes I love it! The plug is the stretchy spiral type so it doesn't hang around getting tangled on my feet while I'm driving
  It was way better than that last stupid cheap one I bought at best buy that the cord wore out on after 2 months
  The sound quality is really not bad once you learn how to adjust the volumes properly
 Everything you should expect from a cassette adapter
In order to get the volumes adjusted for optimal sound quality (without that white noise the tape players give off), adjust your phone or other mobile music device to 75% volume and keep it there while plugged in
  From this point just use your car's volume to amplify the volume
Good luck!
This item doestn work on 2001 Chevy suburban
I tried too many things to get it work but no chances anyways dual position thing is good for using with different players

I have a cassette player in my car and wanted to be able to plug my MP3 player into it
 This adapter looks like a cassette with a wire coming out of the end
 It slides into my car player and when I plug it up to my mp3 player, it plays through the system with no problem
 I have not had any trouble from it yet as others have written about
 I went on a trip 2 weeks ago and used it for several hours
 It worked great
  The wire can be changed to come out of the side or the back, depending on which way your auto player is oriented

I opened it and didn't see where the springs were

 If anybody can take a pic or describe it I will love u so much
 Good product but i was getting the reel error on my tape display in my ford expedition
 It makes my blackberry phone sounds great
 Dislike the radio so please help me

OMG , if u have a tape deck and need AUX use this product , it's not exspensive and sounds great and works with MP3 , CD players , phones 
 its got awsome sound !!! way better than a FM Transmitter !!!!!
I was using an FM modulator, but didn't like that with my iPhone, it would create feedback in the car speakers, so I decided to switch over to a cassette adapter
 This one works fantastic for the price
 Sound quality is fine, about what you would expect from a cassette tape
 The cord can be adjusted to travel from the adapter horizontally or vertically, which is great depending on your tape deck
The only negative I found was that after a few weeks of use, it stopped working properly
 My car's tape deck is an auto-reverse deck, and I have no idea why it worked perfectly for weeks, then shut down on me and stopped, but if you look at J Cristofferson's review, there are tons of comments on how to fix this
 I used these instructions to open the cassette (Carefully, lifting the two screw side so as not to lose all the pieces), and removed the tape reverse assembly
 Then, as stated in that review, remove the metal screw that holds in the white gear without the black band around it, putting the screw and spring back on without that single gear
 Put everyhting back together, and like magic, the cassette works perfectly now, even in my auto-reverse deck
I only wish that it came designed to do this without modifying it, but trust me, opening up the tape and fixing this is so simple
 Takes about 5 minutes, and I have no experience with this kind of thing whatsoever, so if I can do it, you can do it!
Pros:- Love the adjustable dual position for the cord
 Most players you need to insert the cassette sideways, but I had some players before that you need to insert the cassette lengthwise
 You will never go wrong with this adapter as you can feed it to your cassette player both ways
- Does not look cheap
 It looks more decent than other cassette adapters I have that costs 20$- The coiled cord is great and much less clutter
  I had a cassette adapter that has a cord that was too long, it got caught under the seat and the only way to remove it is to cut it
- Sounds good too with my Ipod
Cons:- The only thing I can think of is it still makes noticeable clicking sound while in the cassette
Bought this item twice already

We have a 93 Mercedes which has a tape player that is oriented to take the tape width ways
 This unit can have the input cable changed to accomodate this type of side loading tape
 Sound quality is great
 I did not have to modify the unit like some of the other purchasers have mentioned
 Sometimes the adjustable input cable connector gets loose and just needs to be plugged in tightly

very disspointed not getting a coby cassette tape because it did not work in my car :/ i need my music
Seems great at first
 But sound is kind of shaky, almost like the magnetic head is not making good contact
 Also it has a bad habit of locking up the wheels and it makes the radio think it's hit the end of the tape and will auto reverse only to find it locked again and then reverse again
 It'll get stuck in this infinite loop
 You have to take it out, smack it a few times to free up the wheels and then put it back in
 Oh and that plug for the cable on the tape is loose as hell
 pull on your device too quickly and it'll put the plug right out of the tape while its still in the deck

my car had to get used to it as it is old but after a few try's haven't had any issues with it since and it just plays the music on and on now but i will note it doesn't sound beautiful might be my cars speakers though not sure

I would agree with the majority of the reviews
 I purchased this for my car
 I don't have the MP3 connection but do have a tape deck
 And I wasn't thrilled with the quality of sound with the FM tuners (my brother has one for his car)
 There is a little bit of a clicking sound that appears once it starts playing, but with road nose and the general nose of the car, it is a non-issue


can't even hear it
 The quality of the sound is not as good as if having a direct MP3 connection, but I consider it very good


(not sure it's even fair to compare)
 I use this primarily for audio books, and I am very happy with my purchase
 I have not had to try the fix that some of the other reviewers had (something about needing to take out a pin on the inside of the cassette)
I would definitely recommend!
I fixed the issues, for the time being
  I turned down the bass on my stereo
  I also made the default volume 75% on my phone
  This is the combination that worked for me
  I also left the casette in
  I figured if there was dust and other stuff in there, then i would have to let it settle
  The burn in period was about 3 days
  Afterwards it was AMAZING, the sound clarity improved so much
 So don't give up, try these things
 You may need to clear the dust from inside your tape player, I'm sure that may be the cause of many issues
Fix eject issue:[


]
But will keep this short and sweet -Cord contains lead and must be handled regularly in a car where there is nowhere to clean your hands after touching the thing
Sound quality quickly goes downhill with crackling evident after only 5 uses
Now stuck in my dashboard player because the modular adapter broke off and the cassette will not fully eject
 I am sure the husband will be griping the entire time he tries to get it unstuck
Avoid at all costs!I scanned past the negative reviews since this product had a few really positive reviews with a lot of helpful votes
 Big mistake as now I have to unstick the adapter from my cassette player and try to get Amazon to take it back
 (I bought 2 on clearance)
My car doesn't have an iPod connector so I bought this product
 I have been using this for over a year now and I am very happy with it
 This works amazingly well

These things are just a confidence trick
 They don't do a thing
 They can't do a thing
 If you believe these make your phone work better then you probably find the stripes down the side of cars make them go faster too

Come on Amazon, I can't really believe you are selling this under your own name!
This thing is a waste of paper, it doesn't give u any better reception
 This is a total rip off in my book :-(
I would like to say that this is not cheap junk, but it did nothing at all for my cell reception
On the other hand I have an iPhone with AT&T;, so it could be that combination doesn't work with it
It appears it worked for a few people with a different phone, so I am going to be generous and give it 2 stars, taking into account it could have been my unit
;-)
I gave it 3 stars because I was generously sent a bunch of these on only one order
  Otherwise I am not so sure that these work very well
  I have tried on 2 phones and the results have been inconclusive

Want to try one? They sell these at the dollar stores
 It does nothing to improve your signal

I set my phone down on my computer desk for 10 minutes and I checked the Signal Strength on my Droid X and it read -87 dBm
 After putting the Universal Cell Phone Antenna Booster on the inside of my batter cover I set my phone in the exact same spot for 10 minutes and It read -83 dBm (closer the number to zero the better the reception)
 So I guess it works a little bit
 Check out the picture I posted of the signal strength before and after

DO NOT USE THIS THOUGH IF YOUR PHONE IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY CUZ US CELLULAR SAID IT VOIDED MY WARRANTY, BUT US CELLULAR IS THE WORST CELL PHONE CARRIER OUT THERE
 I SHOULD NOT HAVE EVEN NEEDED THIS WITH A BRAND NEW SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 BUT I DID


THE INSTRUCTIONS COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BETTER IS MY ONLY COMPLAINT
I've always had one of these on my phone
 Had to get a new phone while on vacation and the service at my rental was terrible!!! Slapped one of these on and, I don't know if it's the power of suggestion, but my new phone works soooo much better!!!! Love these things! Recommend!!!
Didn't work, It did not work at all
 I have a dead spot when I drive to work, where I totally lose the Signal
 This device did not help at all
 DO NOT WASTE your money on it
 even for less than $2
00, its not worth anything

I bought tis booster for my phone because I needed better recepion, I tryed it and it made my phone come in a little better I would buy is product again, if fact I bought one for the whole family

i cant say it works because i tryit for a long time on my iphone and it didnt made a difference at all



It helped me get improved signal strength for cellular (phone) communications, but does nothing to improve my Android phone's 3G data signal or WiFi data signal
 I didn't expect it to and I don't think it's design to improve 3G/Wifi so if that's what you're hoping for, forget it
 If you want more bars


 this works very well

Order this product just to find out if it does work

and sure enough I was surprise that I get more bars reception  in my cell than I had before and the price is right

I purchased this for my sisters phone
 She continually has calls dropped, so I got her this signal booster, and it hasn't made a bit of difference
 I bought these before for my previous cell phones, and they really seemed to help
 But apparently not so much anymore

Its simply awesome
 What else to say?
Contrary to what this site and T-Mobile lead me to believe, T-Mobile could not provide coverage at my home address
  This did not stop Amazon
com from selling me the phone, nor T-Mobile from transferring my existing (working) AT&amp;T number to their service (of course, this took two weeks and &gt; 10 phone calls)
After receiving no reception, I called T-Mobile and was informed that they do not actually cover my area
I called AT&amp;T back, and they happily attempted to restore my account, only to find that T-Mobile refused to release the numbers
After a month of essentially no coverage from anyone, my phones are happily back on AT&amp;T where they belong
The bad news is that T-Mobile has sent me a bill for more than double the quoted monthly rate and Amazon
com has not refunded my purchase price
Even in areas where I could get coverage, the phone itself did not work well
  After pressing more than a few keys, the screen would lock up and I needed to remove the battery to reset it
Last warning:  Watch out for the charges for inbound messages--if you really dislike a T-Mobile subscriber, send them lots of text messages (free from their site)--the subscriber has to pay $0
05/message

I've had my T610 for about 3 months now and I'm still in love with it
  I highly recommend getting a bluetooth adapter for your computer to take advantage of customizing this baby
  I've downloaded Midi files, games and photos off the web and copied them to the T610 for FREE!  No SMS charges or web site fees
  It's everything I wanted in a new cell phone
  Camera, color display, fully customizable
  It's great
  Battery life is still good
  Standby about 3 to 4 days, talk about 3 to 5 hours, maybe more
  The down side


 Color display hard to see in bright daylight (but not impossible), it has frozen on me a few times, mostly with internet
  Internal antenna may not be as strong as an external,  but I usually get great reception even with only 1 bar showing (inside bldgs)
  Highly recommend, might want to look into the T626 or T630 for better color display
  Go get it!
Overall, I think that it's a safe investment in a mobile phone
 One sad thing about cell phones is that they improve so quickly, there's always a race to have the best
Right now, this phone is one of the best, without the 300+ pricetag
 If you're paying 300 for it, you aren't getting a good deal
Clear reception, included ear piece is more comfortable than the generics that come with a phone like the R225 Samsung
Great display
 Only downside is the wiping it off thing
 Oils form your skin and ear show up easily on the pristine surface
 Very clear pictures and nice graphics
I give it a 10 out of 10

I've had mine for almost two months now and I'm happy with all aspects of this wonderful powerful phone
  Will definitely buy another S-E phone again in the future
  I still don't like T-Mobile's coverage and especially service support, but this phone is a star
  Some may find teh buttons a bit too small, but they are well-spaced so fine for my large hands
  Voice clarity is superb for me, and the quality/durability is great

Now that I have used the SE T610 phone for almost 2 months with my Palm Zire 72 and HP IPAQ 4155, I must give it 5 stars for the following reasons:1) The Camera is great
 The pictures come out real clear and beautiful after you send it via Email
 Please don't judge the quality of the pictures by what you see on the T610
 I admit that the pictures look a little fuzzy on the T610
 But with only 2MB of memory the purpose of taking pictures is to upload them or send them via Email to others
 The quality of the pictures improves dramatically once they are sent and viewed via one's PC
2) The Bluetooth features on this phone are outrageous
 I have paired my SE T610 using T-Mobile's unlimited VPN GPRS Data Service with my Palm Zire 72, HP IPAQ 4155, and Logitech Mobile Wireless Bluetooth Headset and Performance is Great
 If you got a Bluetooth enabled Palm or Pocket PC, then this is the phone for you
 Sony Ericsson was in on the ground floor on this Bluetooth Revolution
 I send data via my Pocket PC and Palm to my SE T610 via Bluetooth in a flash
 Moreover, web surfing is much faster than I thought via Bluetooth
3) I have absolutely NO problem with signal strength or clarity of voice calls in NYC where I primarily use this phone
 Where I go in the boroughs of Queens, Bronx, Manhatten, Brooklyn and Nassau County (with the exception of Garden City) is great
People need to realize that T-Mobile does not have the extensive network that Verizon or even Sprint has
 So, if you are looking to buy this phone to use with the T-Mobile Network, I can enthusiastically recommend it if you live in most of NYC (outside of Staten Island)
 However, you need to do your own due diligence and check out in advance whether this phone will perform well with your service provider in the area where you live

the freaking power cable quit working w/in a few weeks and neither t-mobile nor sony will fix it for less than $20
  Sony took my address and said they would, but it never showed up
Well the phone is rugged!  It's been 3-4 years and it still works
  It went through the washing machine and half the dryer
  It was submerged in a puddle for 30 minutes-  it keeeps working
The blue tooth syncs w/ my pc and tells me where to go etc
  I buy  a $25 access card every couple of months and avoid the taxes
  It's been a great little phone

Great features - except for the phone one
  Seriously - Bluetooth, IR, good phone book features, nice color display (though it washes out if you are using polarized glasses)
  However, I get much weaker signals (and call quality) on this phone vs
 my previous one
  If everywhere you would use the phone has strong signals, you may be just fine - but if you are on the edge, this is not the phone for you, unless you value the non-phone features more than it working as a phone
 :)
I just called T-Mobile with complaints about my weak battery and told them talk time on the cell phone is 840min according to Amazon's specs for the T610 phone
 T-mobile told me the talk time is 5 hours (300min)
 Who do you believe? I am tired of liars and money-gobbling b*st*rds!
I've had my T610 + Tmobile for about a month now (So no word on the rebates yet) but as for the phone and service


 I've been pretty satisfied
  I get pretty good reception everywhere


 The phone is small and comfortable and everything seems to work on it without a hitch
  The camera is good enough for a cell phone


 and the phone was more pleasing after I got a few new games/themes/ringtones on it via the infrared port
  The phone doesn't have all that much memory but I deleted all the predefined themes/songs/graphics (or at least all the ones it lets you), and that gave me more than enough
  It hasn't frozen on me yet (and mine came with the oldest firmware)
  I heard upgrading the firmware resolves freezing issues, increases the quality/compression of the pictures, and overall makes the phone more useable


 but I none of these things have affected me like others, so I haven't looked into how to upgrade it
  Unfortunately, you cant just update the firmware yourself


  Two of my friends also have the same package and are pretty happy with it
  I think most the reviews on here are just people who've had negative experiences



Considering how old the phones that use this type of battery are, I am not surprised that I received a used battery
 I am a little mad at the fact that the product listing said these batteries would be new though
 The battery I received holds the charge for about a day, which is the same as my old one
Disappointing indeed

Good product
 Quick shipment was provided by the vendor and item was exactly as described
 I am Very satisfied with this purchase
This is an excellent replacement battery, it fit just fine and the price was amazing
 Anyone needing to replace that old battery that won't hold a charge should totally look into getting one of these!
The item is working very good
 My phone does not have problem with power with this battery and me neither

If I'd bought this battery where I bought the cell phone, it would've cost much, much more
  I didn't need a new phone - just a new battery - so instead of adding another used cell phone to the trash heap, I've recycled a used battery and kept the phone I really like!  The phone now works like new!
I bought this to try and repair a POS dash cam, even though this battery is great it was not the issue


 It fit perfectly and accepted charge as it should

Works great
 I've been using this for over a year, seems to hold charge good as OEM (it is OEM)
Bought this for my wife to use with her Samsung Exclaim
 For those that don't know, the device clips to your earlobe after placing the speaker in your ear
 She loves being hands free now
 If you want to go hands free without going the bluetooth route, get this headset
 It will only work in a phone with a 2
5mm jack
 Most smartphones are 3
5mm (like standard headphones)

I love the compact design and fit of the ear rest
 You can barely tell you are wearing this thing
 The mic picks up great! Using this thing all the time now and keeping spares in the car for when bluetooth gets fussy



This serves the purpose if you need your hands free
  You get what you pay for, but I don't need to use it very often, so it is compatible with my phone and is easy to use--not much you can mess up!  If you need one that you will use a lot, you may want to buy something more advanced, but this is a good backup and was very inexpensive

This has to be the cheapest headset I have ever purchased, yet the best small headset ever made
 It lasts forever! I only bought it for Xbox live but it works great with cell phones too
 It says its made by plantronics in the description but the headset itself says verizon on the side so I'm not sure what the deal is with that but I know that it works great
 So if you're looking for a nice regular headset for xbox live because the microsoft headsets break all the time or for a cell phone, buy this headset
 I went ahead and bought another one before they're sold out
 Try to buy from OEM planet if they got it in stock, they are the best in my opinion

I don't know, I've always liked high-tech and loved the idea of bluetooth, even though it tends to make one look like a space alien contacting the mother ship or a blathering fool until someone notices the bluetooth unit in your ear
But I've never gotten good reception with bluetooth units or enough batter life
 Don't get me started on static and wind noise
That's why for the money you can't do better than these wired units
 They're lightweight, comfortable, and have ample cord length
 I've ordered several, and you'd pay 3 times the price in a bog-box electronics store
 Do yourself a favor, even if you do own a bluetooth, keep one of these one hand
 Well worth the price

Overall, it's a great headset for the price
 Pretty amazing actually
 You'll need to get a wired converter to convert the 2
5mm to 3
5mm like this one:Headset Adapter 3
5mm to 2
5mm Audio Adapter and Converter (Black) - Non-Retail Packaging
 No biggie
But the curved rubber piece is really stiff and hurts my ear after about 30 minutes or less
 Sometimes quite painfully
I have a dull voice and this is by far the best headset I have that helps people hear me clearly (I actually have an older version of the same headset, so I have two)
 No one complains they can't hear me or do they need to turn up their volume
 Noise cancellation is also pretty good
 Not as good as my cheap jawbone, but then people usually complain they can't hear me as well on that one
 So, stay away from this if you plan to talk on the phone a while or have larger ears
 Small ears may work just fine
 Mine are probably about average for males
 Otherwise, worth the price

It doesn't fit my phone and now I must return it
 What a hassle! That's all I have to say!
I ordered this based on the rave reviews I saw for it
  I am using it with a Treo 600 and I can barely hear anything out of the ear piece, even with the spongy covering removed

As with so many Plantronics headsets that I have owned, the problem is with the connector jack, the movement of the wire causes the headset to loose contact with the plug-in jack, which at that point they are ready for the garbage bin
 When they are new they work very, very good, excellent sound quality

It's perfect for those of us who don't have smartphones or a headphone jack
 Sound quality is excellent and it makes multitasking so much easier
 Long wire so that you can put your phone in your pocket no problem

This is actually a lightweight comfortable phone headset
  The problem with it is that when the phone rings and you go to pick it up, it takes a while to attach to your ear
  Also, the speaker part is covered by some foam that picks up ear wax and gets dirty extremely quickly - not an item you would want to share with someone
  Once you get past these two problems, the sound quality is good, and it is easy to wear

This didn't work in my phone
 It was rather cheap, I ended up giving it away because it was cheaply made!
I got sick of xbox 360 microphones breaking, so I decided to buy this to see if it would work
Unfortunately it didn't work that well
 I got sound and the microphone worked but I got a lot of feedback and echo
 Worst of all it was supposed to block outside sound, but it didn't do this at all
I know that it was designed for xbox so I am not going to give it 1 star
 I don't have a home phone so I haven't tried it for that

Purchased a total of 3 so far

 1st one had no sound but seller replaced immediately

 others were purchased to use by co-workers instead of the $50
00 apiece ones they were given from verizon purchase

 Stay in ear and work well



Does what it is supposed to and comfortable to wear
  The only downside is there is a slight whooshing sound in the ear piece, may or may not be caused by the phone

This item is useless
  The plug is far too small to fit my phone, despite the description that this will fit "LG phones"
  I own the DARE and this doesn't fit
  The DARE uses the standard jack while this thing is the 2
5 mm whatever
  Who uses such a tiny plug? I've NEVER seen that size on any cell phone!  You get what you pay for
  This item is a joke

This headset would not stay in my ear no matter how hard I tried
  I like the fact that it is small, that it sounds OK, and that the person on the line could hear me OK (not great) But I could not figure out how to keep it in my ear without holding it, which defeats the purpose of having a headset!! I ordered 4 of them, they were about $3 apiece with shipping, and the first two are buzzy and could not be used
  I would not recommend this product
 I went to an over the head headset by Jensen, and am VERY pleased!
It was liked so much that even when it broke the user wanted the same product as a replacement
 I ordered 3

I purchased one of these headsets many years ago and was very happy with it
  Well, my husband tried it and decided he needed it since he did a lot of driving for work
  I was very happy to see that these were still available and at a much better price than what I paid way back
I love that I can use these with my cordless phones as well as my cell phone
  I prefer the corded sets, they just seem to have a better sound quality
  I love that this earpiece fits snuggly around your lobe
  I wear glasses and this works out great
  I go between this style and one that wraps around my head, it just depends on which handset I pick up
  Highly recommend to anyone who prefers the corded headset

well, its a easy product, but it is just I hope buy, it arrive on time and the way I waiting but it hurt my ear
More importantly, the point is that the thing that goes in your ear is a cheap, thin little foam pad that will wear out very quickly
  When mine arrived, it was in little pieces all over the inside if the plastic bag they shipped it in
  No box, no packing - not even some cheap bubble wrap and a rubber band, just chucked it into a bag
  I realize it's super cheap but it should last a month
  Is there we are at now?  I wish Amazon would be


 at all selective on what they offer for sale

Not too sure how to make it stay put, but it seems to work well
  I purchased this headset for my mother and she has not complained about it yet!
Sound was fine through the headset, however the Mic did not work at all
Waste of money and not worth returning

The earpiece is stamped "Verizon" and is of different finish than pictured
 There was no packing slip enclosed but the USPS envelope in came in showed, "ACCSTOP" in Oxnard, CA
 For $2
47, I guess it doesn't matter but still, not the item pictured
  It also came in a little plastic baggie - it was represented as new
Cannot try it as the 3
5mm adapter hasn't arrived from the other item in the earpiece set purchase

I have purchased 4 different Jabra headsets, because they are the most comfortable and easy to hear with, but they have poor microphone quality
 I thought I would try this model, the MX150 Flexible Boom
 Again, sound quality was crap
 I make a living on the phone, so others being able to hear me is very important
I have ended up getting a Ge Tl26593 Earset Microphone by Jasco which has worked the best so far

I've bought about 20 of these things by now, and shared them with many friends & family, who rave about them
  It's comfortable and fits in your ear, and the sound quality (especially the noise cancellation on the mic) is *stellar* - you can be driving down a noisy freeway and the person listening to you will *never* know you're in the car
I tried several Bluetooth headsets and was thoroughly unimpressed: you have to charge them, they add latency, they add extra compression artifacts, and the audio clips in and out on you
This headset has the disadvantage of having a wire, but it's also about 1/20th the price of a Bluetooth headset, and won't give you cancer
  (Ever since I got a large benign osteoma in my skull after, suspiciously, 6 months of very heavy cell phone use, I'm a bit paranoid about cell phone radiation)
The jack is the smaller size (2
5 mm), which is unfortunate, as most smartphones these days are 3
5mm (so you can plug in a headset or just headphones)
  So, once I got a smartphone, I ended up buying half a dozen adapters, because I love this headset so much

I got a pair of Plantronics-branded headsets in Verizon OEM packaging (plastic bag), each coming with a "universal" adapter (micro-USB male to 2
5mm female)
 The price was substantially the same (per unit)
 But there is a small issue--there are two sets of pictures on this product that represent two different units
 The two on the right, with the plastic bag that is clearly labeled MX150xxxx are identical to what I have
 Note the obvious button showing through the plastic (this one mutes, turns off the call or voice-dials on my Blackberry, but it may do other things on other models)
 However, the other photos show the same headset, but without the control button--not a different button, but nothing at all! This made me wonder what is being sold as MX150
 The other issue is color
 It's not clear if you get the black or a gray one or even if there is a choice
 From the photo, one would assume that this dealer supply the gray ones, but I am not so sure
 This is not exactly an item one buys for style points (it's compact, but looks bulky on the face), so it's a minor point, but it would be good to have some clarity
But, as far as the product itself goes, it's perfectly functional for the purpose--cheap branded headset (for me, specifically to complement a BT set, which this one replaces when charge runs out)
 I've had a number of cheap or free headsets (often even enclosed with a phone) and virtually all of them have awful raspy and tinny sound
 That's not what I want in a headset, even for $3
 But I needed an emergency headset and this one fit the bill
 The sound quality is far superior to no-name headsets--on both ends
 It's better than an average Sony/Ericsson handset--I always add a headset to those when using them since Sony deliberately puts crappy speakers into Ericsson phones to make you buy their headsets
 When traveling through NY or DE or any other state that requires no-hands on the phone, it is essential to be quickly disconnect and replace a discharged BT headset
 I have no qualms about using this one
UPDATE (9 months later): I got another of these sets for a friend but, although it fit, the phone rejected it as not compatible
 It was a cheap ATT/Nokia handset to replace a lost phone so I am not surprised about compatibility issues
 But that also meant that I got an extra set
 About a month ago, one of the sets died when the phone got yanked too hard (probably a loose contact)
 At less than $2 each, I had no problem tossing it and pulling out the next one (and I still have two more left, having spent a total of $6, including shipping)
 So, aside from Nokia compatibility, still no complaints

The ony draw back to this product is that it is corded
 IF they could make the same product wireless it would be Exceptional
 I love it, has great sound, cofortable in my ear and it plays the different ringtones i have for callers so i can know whos callings

Bought this as a gift
 Didnt get much feedback from the giftee
 But I';m sure its working fine
 Price was good, not much else to comment on

I have an old style flip phone which uses 2
5mm plugs
 This works well by being clipped to my ear and I can use it to chat hands free

No problems connecting to my pre-existing phone at work
  Ear loops not the most comfortable so I have ordered the behind the head neckband (Plantronics 64397-01 Neckband for CS50/M3000) (waiting for delivery)
  Highly recommended headset regardless!
Like most people I have owned multiple styles of headsets and had varying degrees of success with them
  This Plantronics CS50 is simply the best unit I have ever used
  The unit worked my desktop phone answering system in my office
  I was on the phone every day and for 6 hours or more on a rough day
I got tired of holding a phone to my ear in the office for hours and being 50 feet away from my desk and missing the important call I was waiting for
 This device solved both problems
  The headset unit gives you call answer and end control with your fingertips as well as volume and mute control
  It gave me remote ring detection and allowed me to be up to 300 feet away from my desk and catch that important call
  It would operate for up to 8 hours but it has a desktop control stand that charged the headset while I am in a meeting or at lunch
I used the Plantronics HL 10 Handset Lifter and by touching the button on the headset I could answer the phone remotely with ease
  The sound going both ways was excellent and I never had an issue with the unit
  Other designs I had tried were not always clear and people would complain that they could not hear me
  Not with this unit
  The noise cancelling mike and the cushioned ear piece made for excellent communication and comfortable wearing for long hours during the day
The unit has a fast recharge time in about 3 hours for 100 % full charge from empty
  The headset is extremely light and comfortable and the phone transmission is digitally encrypted for security and privacy
  This is the first tool I would buy if I were setting up a new office today
  It is great!
Very clear transmission of calls both incoming and outgoing
  Easy integration with current phone system
 I would buy again if needed

I took one start off, because I think that these headsets should be ~100 or less for what we are getting, and this one was the best deal that I could find! The plastic housing on the charger unit could be sturdier f they are going to charge consumers these prices for must haves items like this
That being said, this is my first day using it and I have a 12 hour conference call at work, so I may edit my review later
 I am impressed so far
 The setup was super easy
 I plugged it into my VoIP phone and away I went! There was something in the description about &#34;USB,&#34; but this unit is hooks up to the phones headset port via a regular old telephone jacks input
 There is not USB on this model
 The company does make a USB model, but this is not it
 I called Amazon to confirm that before I ordered it and the rep looked it up for me, he was very helpful
I am using the mute feature now, and I like how it beeps every so often to remind me that I am muted
 I can go about my business here without the person on the other end hearing everything that I do, but I can still hear what is being said on the other end
Overall I would say if you are on the phone all day, or work from home like I do, get one!
I purchased FIVE wireless headsets around the same time for my office workers
  One tried to get it to work, and finally gave up
  She kept getting a feedback sound in the headset even when not on a call
  I dont know if it was something in the walls making it have feedback, but we couldnt get the problem to stop so she went back to a wired headset
I have been using the headset she had problems with, and i constantly have that annoying pulsing feedback
One of the five just quit working this week
Problems with 2 out of 5 headsets seems like pretty poor odds to me
I will try a different kind next time


if there is a next time

Mine died and I needed a new one
 Works perfect just like my old one
 Good product would recommend to anyone

I've had this headset for many years (at least 5+, but I can't remember exactly when I got it)
  I am giving it 4 stars for:-simple set up-great sound quality-solid talk and standby time-comfortable, with a variety of wearing options-durability (still serves its purpose after 5+ years)I am taking away 1 star for 2 reasons:-Over the course of several years, the charger has gotten finicky
  If I don't place the headset in just right, and jiggle it a little to make sure it has a good connection, it doesn't charge
  Not a tremeendous problem except for those rare occassions when I forget to double check when I put it in the charger, and I end up with a dead headset
-There is a very noticeable buzz in the line if you use the phone handset, which means you MUST use the headset
  I've looked at set up, but there is really only one way to connect the wires, so I don't believe there is way to avoid this
  The simple solution is to just always use the headset, which is fine, but





on those occassions where the headset is dead (see above), you're left with no great option
  When that happens, I end up having to use the speakerphone on my phone until the headset is charged again
  Not a really big deal, but then I get people asking "talk me off speaker phone", and I have to explain to them that I can't
Since this model is older, the 2 negatives above may have been fixed in more recent models
  Since this unit is still for sale, and apparently people are still buying it, I though I would just write this quick review
One thing to keep in mind




know what you are getting with this
  If you have a typical desk phone, then you will need to physically lift the handset to answer calls, and physically lower the handset to end calls
  You can get a remote lifter that does the lifting for you, but I've never had one, so I can't comment on them
  I've heard mixed reviews about the remote lifters, but do your own research
  Regardless, just know that for a typical desk phone (i
e
 one that is used in a home office, with the phone line going into the phone),  You can't just tap to talk or tap to end the call
  Somebody or something has to raise and lower the handset
  If you have a "soft phone" (calls over the inernet), or are in an office environment with a PBX type system, I can't comment
  My experience is stictly in a home office environment

I bought this for my son and this is what he has to say: &#34;This is a great case and held my phone waterproof on a whole cold weekend trip
 My whole pack got wet and this case kept my phone dry
 I would recommend this to anyone who needs  tough waterproof case
&#34;
I got this otterbox to hold my valuables at the pool this summer
  It is the perfect size for what I need and it is completely waterproof and crush proof
  I put some paper inside of it and held it under water and it was dry as a bone
  Then I had my 100 pound son stand on it and then me at nearly 200 pounds and it did not crack

very durable, water tight, use this in my backpack to keep medical supplies dry, the clamps hold tight with a solid click when shut
This case works great! My wife and I are taking up kayaking and we needed some way to protect our phones
 I have a samsung galaxy s2, she has a blackberry bold 9000
 We each put our phones in our cases and immediately plunged them into the water to test to make sure they didn't leak
 They worked perfectly! My wife even flipped her kayak and that was the true test, we righted it and checked the phone, dry as can be
I recommend these, i do wish there was some padding these came with as the phones do bang around inside a bit
 I'll put my own inside, but for the price I think they could have included something

The product is okay but could be better
 The first problem I had was one of the latches came off immediately upon receipt of the item while trying to open it for the first time
 One is easy to open but the other sticks so it requires some extra force to open
 The latches are apparently designed to be removable so I was able to just slide it back in place but since it is so hard to unlatch I have pulled it totally off on three occasions now
 I could just glue it in place but the fact that it is removable makes me wonder if the manufacturer is planning on it breaking eventually
 Why else would it be designed so it can be easily removed?The second problem I had came after flying with it
 There is no pressure release valve on it and after getting to my hotel I attempted to open this case and could not
 I had to use a pocket knife to pry it open which is fine when I am on the ground but not so fine when I am on a plane where I am not allowed to have a knife
 Upon returning home after another flight I was able to get the case open without my knife but it was not very easy
 Since I bought it to keep some battery backups in for long flights it I don't think it will work for my needs
Edited to Add: So far I have not had any issues opening the box while on a plane
 I still have problems after I land as sometimes it need to be pried open but at least while in the air it opens fine
 I am still using it but be aware that if you fly with it you may need a tool to pry it open after landing

I have one of these filled with charging cables (both dock and lightning) for iPhones and iPads, car chargers, wall chargers and everything needed to power our mobile devices while traveling


 conveniently placed and easy to grab if we're going anywhere, knowing all the while that we don't have to worry about forgetting anything or cannibalizing our cables from around the house
 Keeps everything safe, secure and dry

This phone is amazingly small and light for a camera phone; it even has a flashlight/flash
 Problems the phone has that I find to be a real problem: 1
 The battery life is the worst of any phone I've ever owned
 It MAY last 2 to 3 days in stand by IF I don't use it at all; if I use the phone at all, even just 10 minutes, no more than one day on a full charge
 2
 No voice activated dialing
 I like to use a speaker type hands free kit in the car so I don't have to look at the phone to answer, talk or dial
 I think all phones should have it
 3
 It is not very user friendly
 The menus are not logical and are confusing
 4
 It has an IR but it doesn't sync with your computer
 You can't transfer anything
 I don't get why they even have it
 They have software and cable you can purchase that will let you backup the phone numbers you enter and photos you take, but (5) no syncing with Outlook, your PDA or anything else
 6
 If you buy ring tones or wallpaper, you can't back those up
I do love the phone for its size, weight and even the color, I find it easy to hold and talk with
 The sound isn't the best, but it isn't bad either
 It rings nice and loud and putting it on vibrate is easy
 I can't put the phone in a standard cell phone holder for the car because the camera button is on the side and it's a long key, the holder makes the camera come on
 I had to get a small holder that only grabs in one small area on each side
 I've had to purchased 3 additional batteries and every kind of charger available because the average use of a battery is 15 hours (regular phone use for me is: about 10 minutes a day, use the &quot;t-zones&quot; for a minute or two once a month, in 6 months I've taken a total of 9 photos, and transferred data twice)
 The battery lasted 3 days ONCE, when I was home sick and didn't use the phone and one 24 hour day I had to replace the battery three times as they completely discharged
 I'm use to a battery lasting 5 to 8 days (like this phone says it will last)
I also like T-Mobile
 Their customer service is really good, the features they offer on their web site are great, the prices for wireless modem and wireless web are incredibility great and the national calling price plans are very good compared to what I?ve seen elsewhere
 I was with AT&amp;T since they bought out L
A
 Cellular
 The customer service was great for years, but got so bad I?d wait on hold for hours and couldn?t get through to a person for days

I don't want to rehash all of the stuff that's already been said about this phone
 Here's something that nobody told me before I bought it: You cannot use the Infrared port on this phone to transfer data to and from it using a PC
 You can use the infrared on the phone as a wireless modem for Internet connectivity (this works for me) but the EasyGPRS software provided to manage phone entries etc
 does not work with Infrared
 I've checked out all of the online support forums for this phone and I have not heard from anyone who has actually done this
 When I called tech support they suggest that I buy their data cable (read: shell out another $70) for that purpose
 It is very misleading to show this phone as being IR equipped while its use is crippled
BTW, I gave this phone 4 stars because it is still a sleek looking great phone

This phone is ugly and heavy and has a terrible user interface even for techies like myself
  It also drops calls like crazy here in Manhattan
  The Moto V600 is a much better phone, takes better pictures, gives you better clarity and reception, is smaller, and is much, much cheaper
  Get the Moto V600 if you want T-Mobile
  Stay away from this ugly monster



and I'm from Europe, where the phones and networks are much better than in the States
 I have to say that I think Samsung currently have the best software (and I used to be a huge Nokia fan)
 Amazingly light, very intuitive, great audio, and just looks great
 I recommend this without any reservations whatsoever

I had the Samsung V205 and then I decided to try the E715 out
 FYI to people with battery problems, with these kind of batteries, you must let it drain completely and then charge it

 kind of like building up your battery life and doing this a few times, it will improve your battery life immensely
 I've been a T-Mobile customer for a while now and I stay with them because: 1) They are now no
 1 in customer service, 2) Great rate plans, 3) It works great where I need it the most!Now the additional features that the V205 didn't have that this little gadget has is:1) Caller ID pics

 although you won't be able to see it on the external display, when you flip it open, you'll see that person's face
2) The camera now has a flash as well as a zoom
 And with that, it is able to take pictures in gray (black and white), negative, sepia, and sketch
 Also, you can do multi-shot with this as well as put lots of different kind of frames to your pictures
3)You can download games with the E715 whereas you cannot do so with the v205
 Furthermore, the games are actually java with E7154) The flash can also serve as a flashlight
 Which is quite useful sometimes when you don't know where you're walking and the light is pretty bright
5) Voice memo

 nuf saidOtherwise, it has the usual features
 It has an alarm, calculator, calendar, to do list, MMS, SMS, you can download ringtones (which is a big help since some of the ringtones sound pretty crappy), as well as games and pictures
 Pretty much all the usual stuff is in this phone

 except you won't find bluetooth on this
Another thing is that the external display is like a blue-green thing against a black background

 which is pretty cool since you won't have to press a button just to see the time


 it's always lit up so you can see it well
 Also, the pictures that you can take by lookin at the external display will be a bluish-green color but when it's saved, and you look at it, it's in full color so no worries there
Overall, I have enjoyed this phone and no problems with it really
 Another great thing is that it doesn't have an annoying external antenna to get in the way so it's a good buy

I recently moved to Phoenix, Arizona, and thought it a good time to get a new mobile phone
  A friend recommended Nextel, saying we'd use the direct connect function
  Cool
  So I ordered an i730 from Amazon
  After charging and activating and waiting the required day, I called to get my phone number
  It was a Palo Alto, CA, number!?  That's over 700 miles away!  An 11 hour drive to the next state
  No way close to a local number
  Nextel did not seem to understand or care
  &quot;It's the closest we have
&quot;  &quot;There are no 602 area code phone numbers left
&quot;  I begged for maybe a 480 number or anything that is a local call from here in Phoenix
  Nothing doing
  After a few more days and a few more calls to Nextel that went nowhere, I called Sprint (who have not been customer service stars to me in the past) and within four minutes had a local 602 Phoenix number working on my current Sprint phone
  I canceled the Nextel service
  They are charging me $35 (expected) plus $11
53 in taxes, fees and assessments &quot;we can't change&quot; for a couple of days when all I called was customer service
If you buy the phone, I hope Nextel has a local area code for you, because if they don't you are stuck for $46
53 and an Amazon return
  It was a pretty color screen though 
 
 

And it was pretty much worth it (if you sign the plan and get the phone for $250)
 Otherwise it is a little pricey
 The gain was enough to make me feel good about buying it though, and my plan was up anyway so no remorse there
 It's difficult to tell from this picture if your i95 is any bigger - but it is less bulky
 The features are the same but a little better
 And of course GPS is nize

I've glanced at a few reviews and looked at the overall review for this phone, and think it's a little underrated
  I've had a couple weeks to try out mine, and the battery life with my usage is 3-4 days, and I use the phone for short calls about 5 times a day
  The phone doesn't squeak when squeezed, and all of the construction is tight (even the flip screen doesn't wiggle much)
  I saw a few complaints about the weight of the phone, and even a complaint about the metal battery panel
  It's called quality, sometimes quality weighs a little, and if the phone makes your pants fall down when it's hooked onto your jeans, buy a belt
  The phone employs java applications, so you can download programs to fit your needs from nextel, at a cost
  You can also get them from third party sites, also ringtones, wallpaper, etc
  The phone uses GPS, can locate your approximate position for free, with software it can give you directions from one location to another for free (navigational software), called telenav
  The quality of the speakers and microphones on this phone is great
  The speakers can be loud enough to hear in different rooms of the house, or quiet enough you can barely hear them
  The sound is crisp, even on direct connect
  Also, an answer to the slams against nextel itself, don't listen to it
  The only problem is their tech support does not operate 24/7,  other than that their customer service is as good as any service based organization I've ever worked with
  This phone is full featured, it isn't exactly a PDA phone, but it's software capability and 65k color screen make it perform many of the same functions as a PDA
  Great phone, if nextel services your area, you won't be disappointed

Other than the high initial cost (I got it before they put in a promotion, duh), i really love this compact and stylish phone
  It's the best Nextel has offered yet, although there's rumor that a camera phone is coming out soon
  If you can wait, wait a bit longer, otherwise for walkie-talkie style cellular, Nextel is the best
  No delays like with Verizon (up to 30 seconds!) or Sprint (10 secs)
  Walkie-talkie that actually works where there's coverage
  I'm a happy customer

I don't own this phone
 I own the cheaper Motorola (Nextel) i710
 I have many friends who own this phone though, although a few of them have since "downgraded" to the i710
The main reason I chose the i710 over this i730 was signal strength
 the i710 consistently gets better signal the the i730 no matter which of my friends phones I compare it too
 All my friends are on the same wireless plan from Nextel as I am, so I know its not service, it is definitely the phones
I can have full bars on my phone (5 including the little antennae icon) and my friends phone held right next to mine will have 2 or 3 bars
 My phone gets signal in places their phones are "Out of Service
"Now you might say that maybe my friend just has a dud phone
 Well I have 4 friends who have the i730, 5 friends with the i710 and one with the i860, all from Nextel, and the i710's always have better signal compared to the i730's
 The i860 gets as good a signal as the i710 (but its significantly more expensive too)
I am not sure why two phones based on the same hardware and software have such drastic differences in signal
 The only thing I can think of is some hardware added to give the i730 an external screen somehow interferes with the antennae hardware somehow
Other than signal strength compared to the cheaper and basically identical (except for external screen) i710, the i730 is a pretty good phone
 Lots of features, solid and durable construction and good battery life
 For me signal was more important that a silver case an an external screen but if you like those things the i730 is a decent phone to use

I have to say that this is a great phone and the Nextel service is great also
As for the review from the moron from Denver You need to have used it and the service before you open your mouth and make a fool of your self
People that review something and not have a clue just goes to show that stupid people should not breed
I have had the I90c,I95cl and the i730 and the 730 is great as for a alarm buy a clock if you need a alarm
The screen is a little smaller but the brilliant color makes up for it,the sound is as good as the other phones I have had
As for service I have had every carrier that is in the state of Colorado and Nextel is the best and for any one who is thinking of Verizon for push to talk well it sould be push to wait
If you want the best this phone and service is the best

I will not hash over the things that many other wrote in their reviews, but mainly will focus on the problems that I've had with this phone over the course of 1 year that I've had it
1) Battery life is not nearly as good as advertised - lasts about 8 hours - but I admit to be using the phone often and need to swap batteries (have an extra one in the charger) because the wire charger would not charge the phone! (another story altogether) However, my cranky old Samsung (a generation prior to e415) used to last 2 full days on an extended battery with same or greater amt of use
2) Familiar problem - phone's earpiece is too quiet
3) Software's pure crap - the phonebook is not only not intuitive, it would save phone numbers under different people's names! No, not my mistake - checked this several times, and then spoke to a sales rep who said that this does indeed occur with this phone
4) Poor reception - the said Samsung had a much better reception in buildings
 And it wasn't Sprint service either - T-mobile and Sprint are equivalently bad
5) Setup - very panful to readjust setup options/ringers
Overall, I don't like this phone at all
 Very poor fundamentals - but it looks cool and has a (very useless, but still cool) camera
And, judging by Motorolas of my friends (Nextel models aside), I don't think I want to own another Motorola product
 When's the new Treo coming out again


?
A phone which has got lots of very useful features and functions
Pros:Very Good reception
 Works great inside buildings
Clear beautiful color screen and camera
 One of the best out thereCons:The buttons are kind of small and needs getting used to
Little bulky if you compare it to a Samsung flip phones
 But does things better than the Samsung

The front screen went out on my S105 and T-Mobile wanted me to buy another phone since my warrenty was up
  From the deal I'm seeing on here, i wish i could have just canceled and got a new account, but thats too much effort



 anywho, my choices boiled down to getting the E105 or this v300
  I chose the v300 b/c of the extra gadgets (mainly the camera and speakerphone) even thought the rep said samsung users have a hard time getting used to the Motorola OS
She was wrong!  Navigation of this phone was a breath of fresh air!  i will say I preferred how the phone book was layed out better in the S105, but everything else is easier to use on this phone and the T-Zones is so much more functional!  I'm going to have to upgrade my plan to allow more internet usage! There also seems to be a much better seleciton of 3rd party applications and games for this phone which makes for better usability IMHO
Reception is the same as far as i can tell between the two (meaning signal strength)
  Clarity is a tad better in the S105, but nothing worth chosing that over this
  If there is even the slightest background noise, they sound the same
  The S105 and this are almost identical in size, but the E105 was smaller


 not a bid deal to me
Bottom line: If you are a prude about clarity and size, go with E105
  If you want more from a phone than just making calls, get the v300 (or higher)

I've been using this phone for a few months now and have had a chance to use most of the features
  Most of them are pretty standard to cell phones these days, but a few things are worth commenting on:-Great speakerphone
  Very loud and clear sounding, both ways
-Decent battery life
  Almost lasts a week with minimal usage; 2 days with heavier use
-Battery meter is very inaccurate below 1/2 charge
  Seems chronic with Motorola phones
-Nice, clear display
  A bit hard to see in the brightest sunlight, but other than that, no problems
-Camera is of average quality at best
  Takes okay pictures for a new wallpaper, but that's about it
-Serious annoyance: One of the side buttons that remain exposed when the phone is closed controls the type of ring/vibrate
  It's very loud if you don't already have the phone on silent/vibrate only
  Basically, to quickly change to phone from a loud ring to silent--say in a theater--you have to make a loud noise
  Very short sighted
  And since the button is exposed even with the phone closed, you end up hitting it by accident quite a bit
Overall, I'm pretty happy with the phone
  I could've chosen a smaller phone with a better camera, but not with a speakerphone, or with speakerphone, but not at this price
  (


)  Can't beat it on value

First a quick confession: I do not like T-Mobile
  I had them before and hated their (lack of) coverage and bad service
That said, the v300 is a very good phone
  I won't rehash the long feature list here
  What I really like (after playing with a friend's) is the loud ringtones, the good reception (despite the lack of GSM coverage in Brooklyn), and the great styling
  This phone is not made by Motorola per se but by their Asian partner, maybe that explains the &quot;girlish&quot; styling, but it's still pretty cool
  Of course, the light weight and good battery life make it a stand-out
My favorite phone is still the Sanyo VM-4500 video camera walkie-talkie speakerphone cell phone for Sprint PCS



This phone was purchased with the T-Mobile plan to replace a Nokia phone with AT&amp;T
  I changed phones and service because my old phone could not get reception inside of buildings
  I chose the V300 due to the external antennae
  I have had the phone for two weeks now and I have been very pleased
  The reception is a bit tinny sometimes, but overall I have not had any problems with dropped calls
I text message quite frequently and the phone offers you two choices for writing your text
  The first is an intuitive text entry method where the phone guesses the words that you are trying to type and displays them on the screen for you to choose
  This method is supposed to save time, but I have not yet gotten the hang of it
  The second method is the tried and true press each button for each letter method
  My only problem with the phone is that the buttons are not the same shape and are spaced apart which makes text messaging a bit trickier at first
  Plus the numbers and letters which are written on the buttons are very light and I often have to shift the angle of the phone in order just to read the buttons
  The light text might also be an issue for someone with vision problems
Overall, I would recommend this phone
  The only reason why I gave it four stars instead of five is because I think that Motorola needs to darken the text on the buttons for those users who like to text message or who have vision problems

I recently used two of the plug on a trip
  I used the one for Chile and Argentina and they both worked perfectly
  I would recommend this set

They look cheap but work great
 I took these on a trip to China and had no problems at all

UPDATE:The person actually using these adapters (an 80 year old grandma) just reported from Bassano Italy that they worked just find and she charged her phone with no issues
 So if a octogenarian can deal with something, that speaks volumes to the product!In her case, she was using an iPhone overseas, so any issues of power converters were moot
 All she had to do was plug the US style plug into the adapter
 Even so, it did work for her and she did it on her own
 So that is a plus!**********************************These little adaptors look like they are well made and the price was right
i will add more when I get back!
Bought this for a trip to Europe (Netherlands) and it worked perfectly without any kinks
 I am quite pleased with my purchase

I was happy with this purchase
 Just returned from a Europe trip where I used this to convert and charge my electronics (Iphone, Ipad 3) and was very impressed
I was concerned it might fry my Ipad 3, but I was assured by an Italian gentleman in an electronics store, that it would be just fine, and it was!So I recommend this

I bought this set of adapters specifically for a trip to Europe
 There are two different Europe plugs, I took them both, and they both worked everywhere I went
I used the adapters primarily in Denmark and Norway, they worked great and gave me no problems charging iPod, iPhone, iPad, camera batteries, etc
Note that there are numbers on the plugs, the numbers correspond to the cardboard insert to let you know where to use the plugs
 It would be better if the plugs themselves had that information on them, but at least they have the numbers (which I didn't see at first so I put my own numbers on them)
I will undoubtedly keep using the adapters on future trips, and I'll keep this updated
Update:Have also now used in Thailand, worked great

Works as it is supposed to, lightweight, compact, and very economical
  Covers nearly every plug Ive ever needed in Asian except for India

A few months ago, Sabrent sent me several samples of car inverters to try out, and I have been pleased with all of them so far
 This review is my honest opinion
As I have mentioned in a previous review, these power inverters are not new and have been around for many years
 Still, with mobile devices spreading like chicken-pox at a kindergarten, I have seen an upsurge in the amount of USB-charging inverters on the market
 This particular charger offers dual USB charging (1A and 2
1A ports) as well as a standard power socket
 Let's cut to the chase: this inverter functions excellently
Form is the only area I have to take issue, and it's not Sabrent's fault
 My 2003 Subaru Outback has the AUX power (cigarette lighter) low down on the console, right behind the shifter, and with this inverter plugged in it's actually quite dangerous for me to have USB cables sticking out
 If you're in the same boat as me, I highly suggest another inverter from Sabrent, also 150W:Half a star was taken off for the bulkiness of this product, another half star was taken off because I find the LED to be too bright and rather distracting during night-time driving
If you have the space, this is an excellent converter and a solid price
 Recommended for most, reservations for some


It's no problem charging mobile devices while you're driving, since these devices can be charged from a USB port, either built into the vehicle (newer models) or from USB chargers that fit in the vehicle's power port (aka cigarette lighter)
 But a lot of small electrical appliances are only made to work with AC power, and for those devices, a 12-volt in-vehicle power inverter is the answer
 I have bought dedicated power adapters for laptop computers, but these are expensive and usually only work with a particular model laptop
 I tried the Sabrent 75-watt inverter in my Subaru, and it worked fine for providing both AC and USB power
 I used it with two of my AC-powered camera battery chargers and a AA battery charger:Canon G10 battery charger - 14 wattsNikon D3200 battery charger - 20 wattsMaha AA battery charger - 16 wattsI also used the inverter to charge my HP laptop while using the laptop
 The laptop uses a maximum of 50 watts while running, which is well below the inverter's limits
 While using the inverter for AC devices, I also recharged my Android smartphone with the 1A USB charging port
One caution: Every vehicle's electrical system has a maximum rated power that it can deliver through the vehicle's power port
 For my Subaru Forester, the owner's manual says this is 120 watts
 Trying to power a device or devices that exceed that limit will likely blow a fuse
 I should also note that Subaru sells its own 100-watt power inverter for my vehicle, but it costs about $300, while the Sabrent inverter is a small fraction of that amount
For anyone who has a need for AC power in their vehicle, the Sabrent inverter is a good option to consider
 The inverter is also available in 150 watts (Sabrent 150w Power Inverter with 2
1A-1A Dual USB Charger 12v DC to 120v AC (PW-C15U)) and 300 watts (Sabrent 300w Power Inverter with 2
1A-1A Dual USB Charger 12v DC to 120v AC (PW-C30U))
A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes

Bought this thing years ago and it hasn't stopped working
 It was a little noisy but under the seat it was fine
 I haven't used it recently because not needing it

A very nice power inverter, especially for the price
 Just be aware of the wattage required for what you're trying to run
 I purchased this intending to operate a coffee pot, with no result
 After doing some research I find a coffee maker needs somewhere around 1000 watts to run

I'm standing in a room with a TV blasting, just 10 feet away
  Talking to Hertz reservations - they tell me (a) my voice is the clearest one that they have heard all day and (b) they don't hear the TV at all
  I replace this unit with my old earphone
  "Now your voice sounds muffled", he said, "and I hear that TV now loud and clear"
I have other stories like this
  Walking down a busy noisy street - the Etymonic makes my voice clear and there is no noise of traffic or wind
  My old earphone almost seems to exaggerate the background noise
I use the foam ear piece and it is very comfortable and stays in place
  I don't like the hard plastic ear pieces
Nice

I started using this headset two days ago
  Sound is good
  You can speak at a normal volume level and you will be heard
  I don't use it outside though
  The earplug does give you a sense of being underwater, the way it blocks your whole ear canal
  But that's how it blocks out noise
  I do think for the money there should be some sort of volume/mute control on the cable
  But, I knew there wasn't when I bought it
  My only complaint is that it comes with a case, yet the headset doesn't fit in it without bending the microphone stalk and I'm not comfortable doing that
  It's sensitive equipment, with a filter in the earpiece that I know I'll have to change eventually hence the included tool for same, then it shouldn't be left in the open to collect dust
  Why not give a case that accomodates it and its accessories?UPDATE 4/30/08:  After months of using this headset, I have to say I find it mildly annoying
  You feel like you're hearing something under water, because the thing is so jammed in your ear (it's a little bit violating


)
  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone shopping for a headset
  I really bought it because it was so hard to find a headset compatible with my AT&T; 8525

The sound of this headset is excellent, as advertised
  The trouble is in getting it to stay in place when I move around
  I'm not talking about playing tennis here, I'm talking about driving the car, and having the boom slowly swing downwards away from my mouth
  The ear plug stays in place, and I can still hear, but the boom swings downward from in front of my mouth (pulled by gravity) and then the person I'm talking with can't hear me so well
  The only thing that works for me in this regard is Plantronics, the one the hooks behind your ear lobe, but that one is not noise-canceling, so I can't hear as well when the wind noise gets high in the car
  The ones that hook over my ear hurt me, and the ones that just plug into my ear usually fall out
