The screen, however, is small for internet use, but it allows connection for email through various providers.
This firmware gives you kinetic scrolling (iphone like scrolling) and a lot of other fixes.

Too bad because I like the simple model, the screen is easy to read and I can carry it in my pocket.
One other minor negative is that it seems the screen can be scratched easily.
The phone is unresponsive and the screen is too small.
The touchscreen keyboard is okay for me (small finger tips) but quite inconvenient for my husband.
but due to small screen size, not much is gained by the higher resolutionCall quality is excellentBattery life: it will make it through the day on a single charge.
On icon screens the 5800XM requires only a single tap to open but on some of the menus 2 taps are required.
I think this is one of the cheaper phones which has touch screen capabilities without having a contract (of 2 years usually) and no data plan required.
