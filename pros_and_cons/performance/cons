This is not a smart phone, this is a wanabe smart phone, and it failed miserably.
This phone sucks Its a basic smart phone for beginners I hate it you cant do really anything on it but like talk and text if you try to download an App it takes like an hour to download and to go online its super slow picture quality is horrible and there is no flash on camera I would never recommend this phone to anyone unless its for a child.
You will need to connect a fast charger to the base (instead of the phone).
I have become so accustomed to smartphones, that going back to T9 is a little confusing.
I mention this because it is hard to communicate back and forth.
Too bad because I like the simple model, the screen is easy to read and I can carry it in my pocket.
not matter how hard the people at unlockedcellphonekings tried to help me, it was no use.
With the updates the phone functions a little smoother.
