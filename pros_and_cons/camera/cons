2 camera picture quality is too bad.
What I don't like1/ Making a phone call is pathetic - how many clicks do I have to make in order to make a simple phone call.
(you will have a hard time with 1-800-CAL-WHAT)iPhone killer: (differences with the iphone)Better CameraBetter Music playersturdierBetter upgrading optionsLower costBetter browserMature OS (with Flash)Support for A2DP bluettoth (clear sound in bluetooth headphones)Better screen ResolutionMore touchscreen inputs (like stylus and handwriting)2 cameras and support for video calls.
And the picture snaps -not great quality but I have down loaded many from my phone card.
Forget about taking selfies as there is no front camera and no flash so forget about taking pictures in the dark.
