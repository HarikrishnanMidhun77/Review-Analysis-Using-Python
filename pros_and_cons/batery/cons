You will need to connect a fast charger to the base (instead of the phone).
Beside the poor battery life I recommend this phone.
Battery life is not great.
And the battery in the phone would not hold a charge thank God I still have the other phone, and I put it in the phone to see if it would work and that old battery works like a charm.
Negative: to conserve battery the phone shuts off the display until you open it, which means that you can't see the hour or if you have a missed call or a message.
If you talk a lot over the phone and tired of phone out charge then you choice has to be this phone.
If I have a heavy texting day, the battery life plummets.
