I thought it was a reasonable price for a Nokia touch screen phone with WiFi, 3G, GPS, etc.
This is a good and durable cell phone, though I bought this 2 years ago at $75, so I guess is a little overpriced right now, compared to all new options available on the market these days.
Great phone at a great price.
great phone at good price.
A friend mentioned this phone to me and it worth what he said.
For this price this is an excellent phone.
I really like this phone seems like it is made really good, I do not have AT&T as my sever I have devote30 for $30 a month unlimited and taxing ,and this phone works grate ,it is a perfect size phone not to big or to small, I like that fact that I can go to another server and use it as long as they take AT&T phones ,,I can here nice and clear,,I just like this red color ,its charges real fast and the battery lasted all day and that evening I was on the phone for over five hours calling everyone and giving out my new number before the battery went dead it did beep to let me know the battery was low, I have no regrets getting this phone thinking of getting another one just so I have it for the future,, in case I brake or lose this one,,I really like the different headset plug in its different then most it's long and flat plug but seems that it will not ware out like the other ones do,,you do need to order the right head sets for AT&T samsung a777,witch Amazon has at a cheep price, witch I did and it works grate or you can buy the adapter,witch I also did so I could use my more expensive head sets on it as well,I also bought the case for this phone and it is well wroth it,.
The price was great at less than $175.
Takes great pictures for the price range.
Good product at a great price.
very happy with the smartphone, running 4g right now with movistar venezuela carrier i recommend greatfully this seller, great seller, great price, great smartphone.
It is a great phone for any senior, and I love the 5 start touch button that allows the caller to get immediate assistance ( additional cost, but worth it.
Aside from that one thing, this phone is a great buy for the price I got it.
OK for its price and good for elder people who only use the phone for calling.
5 GB of ram which isn't really noticeable unless you are heavily multitasking- Camera struggles to focus and stay focused at times but otherwise takes great photos- Runs android Lollipop right now even though Marshmallow is out (I hear they are releasing an update soon)- No active display or LED notificationIt's unfortunate that the market is saturated with phablets and we have very little choice when it comes to conservatively sized devices, but all in all I think this is a great phone (especially for the current price of $264).
Great phone very easy to use simple I love it works well price is great to.
This phone is great for the price.
I like the phone, it's great for the price, but I'm writing this review to warn other buyers, the phone i got IS NOT NEW.
Thankfully Amazon allowed me to return this phone and T-Mobile was willing to cut their price some since I had to buy it from them and wasn't happy about it.
Otherwise, the phone was very good -- lots of stuff for the price and the GPS works when you aren't in a service area.
This phone is a great deal for the price I paid.
This phone is great and I got it for a good price ($485).
GREAT to be able to buy a low cost phone without a 2 year obligation.
Replacement for my dad's phone (he's very low tech-LOL) and it works great and was a great price.
great for the price touch screen very sensitive but love the key pad letter are larger than my old phone.
This cellphone is cheap in price and quality.
Good @ the price.
The price was great the phone came brand-new in the box with the accessories.
Was a good stop stop gap phone for me in between phones for the price as well.
But is worth it cuz this phone is really fast and the apps from Microsoft and Lumia are wonderful.
Nice having a bigger screen without forking out for a Samsung or Iphone (shows my age im so cheap.
It's pretty good phone for low this price.
great phone, good price.
Pretty cheaply made phone.
good price, good product.
Nice phone at this price.
When it comes to mobile phones Nokia always strikes me as being one of the most durable at a reasonable price, hence the reason my attention went straight for the Nokia phone because any mobile phone owned by my husband really needs to stand the test of durability as he doesn't take much care in protecting it.
If you are looking for a reliable phone that makes great quality calls, has good battery life and is reasonably-priced then this is the phone for you.
Got a great inexpensive plan.
They feel cheap and are cheap, but they are surprisingly durable, have great battery life, and just plain work.
Clarity could be better - the sound IS NOT comparable to a land line phone - but voices are less muffled than on the cheap Go-phones with which we've been making-do.
This is a great phone at a great price.
Excellent phone, well worth the purchase.
The map app is just OK (it's no Google Maps), the app selection is pretty lame (the Nokia store doesn't offer much), and the games that are actually worth playing and the phone can handle (it only plays Java games) are few and far between.
This is a good and durable cell phone, though I bought this 2 years ago at $75, so I guess is a little overpriced right now, compared to all new options available on the market these days.
you can buy the Nokia X3-02 TOUCH AND TYPE WHITE Unlocked Phone this very nice, the price and the cost.
Good phone in a very good price.
Well worth the money, nice little cell phones with no fancy features, just a telephone to have in your pocket.
i have had this phone for about 4 months and is great u have everything u need on it, u also can download vey useful aplications so is like a little pc, very good price for than amazing phone.
It's a good value for the price paid.
over all, I think this phone worth of the price, it still a nice phone since no phone is perfect.
It cost a third of what my smartphone was costing me and has most of the features.
The quality is good, as an used cell phone with a low price, the quality exceeds my expecation.
For this price this is an excellent phone.
)
but nowhere near the low price of this phone.
