 All in all I would recommend this phone and vendor highly if you want the features of a smart phone but you don't need GPS or a big data bill every month for a bunch of things you don't need or want to keep you life running smoothly

 Anyway - if you want a phone that texts very easily, has a 4-day battery, a very convenient and useable features, and yet not crack open the crack-pipe of the internet constanly, the Asha 302 does it with style and then some
Phone was not new, it was not unlocked and battery doesn't work

 main issue is that battery is not as advertised, i only use it to send sms messages (few per day) and i need to fully recharge battery after a week
 The only reason i give it a 4 star instead of a star is that it charges using a charger that is not a micro USB, which means if you lose your charger or forget it it may be difficult to find another one as i have not seen this type often ( its a small plug) but other than that functions great and is reliable especially if all you want to do is make calls or text

is a Chinese product of very poor quality, this is a scam, it is not an original Nokia product, the price is not also worth the cover of the battery defective wine, in addition to last long in coming, not recommended at all the reputation of seller, I hope amazon punish him for mocking their customers
 The battery cover is easy to remove but I do it breaking if you're a power user with a spare battery and you want to constantly swap the batteries out with a fresh one

 A couple of weeks ago, I contacted the seller about the battery since it would not hold a charge more than a day, and if I talked on it, only a few hours, but they said that there was nothing they could do about as I`d had it too long

 except this particular phone would not charge
 At first it charged with no problem
 It sat "idle" for a couple of days (no one used it) and it never would charge again
I don't like it, don't charge very well
It's something wrong with the battery 
 Starting with the organized feel, splash screen, the way contacts are grouped and topping with the batter life which is just lousy, this phone just doesn't feel like a Nokia phone
 The Seller was nice enough to sent me a fresher battery; it did not iimprove sufficiently to make a big difference
 It takes forever to charge
 After 10 hours of keeping on charge, it wouldn't have enough charge to switch on fully, let alone function
 It would take a full day to charge and then drain in a day
Nokia is supposed to have good phones that keep their charge for a long time
 Checked the charger and the battery - both seemed to be fine so it must be something badly made inside the phone

I was very disappointed when I open the pack, no cover, no battery, and was locked for ATT, for what I paid it was a lost, I had to purchase another one at the storeVery disappointedSorry, never again
 Battery life is not great
 I don't even have to charge the phone everyday
 it won't connect and it loses its charge
The numbers and writing are way too small and the battery does not last very long 
 Only in the water for less than 5 seconds, I pulled the battery, let everything dry and it appeared it was going to work, but then died two days later
 Also, any time it got dropped, even on carpet, the whole thing would fly apart, battery cover, battery and phone would all part ways
It is exactly what I wanted, not flimsy, great sound, holds a charge longer than any I have ever had
 Only complaint on this one is short battery life

We received the phone, followed instructions from removing the battery to inserting the SIM card went to charge it but it never turned on

 Had an issue with incorrect charger being sent but that was remedied quickly

 It is easy to use but I find it does not hold a charge as long as my old Nokia phone did
On my previous Nokia flip phone, I was used to seeing the battery gradually discharge and I knew when it was time to recharge

battery symbol just goes red
 When I took off the back of the phone to remove the battery so that I could install my SIM card, it was a real chore to get the back to "click" in
 Well they "fixed" it only for her to get it back with the battery cover falling off
- Charger that came with it is pretty flimsy and loses connection while charging a little easier than I would like
 The slot for the SIM card is under the battery
 The phone looks new, and it has a great battery life

 We have searched to see if we can buy a replacement battery to no avail

 I charged the battery with my old 6350 Nokia and after pressing the on button for at least 30 minutes it finally turned on only to have it turn off again after several weeks

The phone works fine, but the battery cover is very flimsy
 Had to purchase another battery :(
My husband likes his Nokia Cell, however something is wrong with the battery and its off by itself every five to ten second and its hard to figure it out what's happening because no manual booklet came with the phone
