Clear phone call quality and easy to use Nokia OS.
This is my first smart phone and although I was spoiled with my simple flip phone, I am learning to love the many features.
Nokia Xpress is a bit sucky but I downloaded an Opera browser for the phone and it works slightly better so internet experience is pretty easy.
Even so it's a great format, super fast and super easy to learn and use.
Great phone very easy to use simple I love it works well price is great to.
This is all I'm looking for, an easy to use and great looking phone.
, not smart), and you want a qwerty keyboard to do your texting on, this is a great phone.
Although not a "smart phone" this compact device is feature-packed with a camera for stills and video, a real music player, a real FM radio using your headset as its antenna, Bluetooth and USB, and data storage on a mini SD card.
The smart phone type features are easier and faster to use than any smart phone I have used.
The Nokia 6350 is a good phone for individuals who do not want a smart phone.
The phone is great to hold, looks nice, works fast and smooth.
After i broke my focus I bought from att, I tried to save a little money buying from amazon, i bought my replacement from blutekusa, it came fast like they said and in a different box then at&t woulda came in, after two weeks i tried to plug it into the computer and it said device was malfunctioning, they sent me a new one as said, second came with no plug for the wall outlet charging and after two days it wont stop turning on and off.
It's a simple phone that is easy to use for phone calls and texting.
