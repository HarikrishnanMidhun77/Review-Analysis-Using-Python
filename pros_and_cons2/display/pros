I have a month with him and has not given me any problems, I like the touch screen, good sound, the memory of everything you want to save.
It is simple to use, I love that you can have multiple #s associated with one name, love the touch of the key pad and the bigger display on screen if wanted.
Overall, it works great and, even though this is my first touch-screen phone, I find it intuitive enough to easily figure out what I want to do.
This is a good phone although it seems to have a small screen.
The touch screen responsiveness is also not that good.
As a media device it features second to none audio quality (with good encoding and headphones it sounds incredible), and a truly amazing screen for photo viewing and video playback.
