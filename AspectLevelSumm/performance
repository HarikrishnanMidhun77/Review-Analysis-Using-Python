Also, unlike later “smartphones,” your access to the Internet is strictly through your cellular service (in my case Consumer Cellular); there is no Wi-Fi capability for charge-free access at home or any “hot spots” on the road.
All in all great for anyone starting smart phones.
The positives, clear bright screen, fairly fast, Wifi, decent picture quality.
As a long time smart phone owner (original iPhone, iPhone 3GS, Moto Droid for 1 month and Nexus One for 8 months), I was very excited to get my Samsung Captive.

I have become so accustomed to smartphones, that going back to T9 is a little confusing.
This is my first smart phone and although I was spoiled with my simple flip phone, I am learning to love the many features.
A good, unlocked smartphone that meets all and more that I need to stay connected.
This is not a smart phone, this is a wanabe smart phone, and it failed miserably.
This phone sucks Its a basic smart phone for beginners I hate it you cant do really anything on it but like talk and text if you try to download an App it takes like an hour to download and to go online its super slow picture quality is horrible and there is no flash on camera I would never recommend this phone to anyone unless its for a child.
This Samsung has the same powerful performance of the expensive smartphones at a very attractive price.
There is nothing to complain about, I'm glad to have this smartphone.
I would recommend this to anyone with a GSM carrier that wants a great up to date smartphone.
We have android based smart phone and Kindle Fire, so I want something slightly different.
It was affordable, fast, and I loved the big bright screen.
Bought this for hubby because he just needs a phone to call & text, not a smartphone.
I actually like the fact that it fits into my purse's phone pocket compared to some of the other newer smart phones and this is great for when I travel.
Love it , the battery life lasts longer than my smart phone.
This is our first smartphone.
, not smart), and you want a qwerty keyboard to do your texting on, this is a great phone.

Clear phone call quality and easy to use Nokia OS.
It was very quick and easy trip to the cell phone store to setup.

It has 3G tec, batery life is also good, menu is friendly and easy to work.
The OS is reliable, stable, very easy to use, and the battery life is pretty decent.
Nokia Xpress is a bit sucky but I downloaded an Opera browser for the phone and it works slightly better so internet experience is pretty easy.
Even so it's a great format, super fast and super easy to learn and use.

It's easyenough to mess-up and have to start over.
It's unlocked, and I'm outside the US, and it was quite easy, I just slip in the sim and it worked perfectly with the local network.
I have T-Mobile service and it was very easy to simply switch my SIM card to this phone from my old one.
So, since I am no fan of smart phones, and frankly there is no other rugged phone (with termometer, compass, flashlight, noise meter) that is available in Europe I was amazed to see the new 5140s on Amazon.
The full digital keyboard is easy to use with the stylus (a bit tough for those of us with fat fingers.
But is worth it cuz this phone is really fast and the apps from Microsoft and Lumia are wonderful.


You see, I have AT&T as my cell phone provider and they will automatically charge you a data plan once their computers recognize that your SIM card is in a smartphone.
It was very quick and easy trip to the cell phone store to setup.
The Nokia 6350 is a good phone for individuals who do not want a smart phone.
I know I will be forced into a smart phone sooner rather than later, but I found I definitely like this phone better than anything else I can afford right now.
Not a bad phone when your not into smart phones.
not matter how hard the people at unlockedcellphonekings tried to help me, it was no use.

The smart phone type features are easier and faster to use than any smart phone I have used.
Being upgradeable with its memory is a definite plus and you can even have many memory cards since it's hot swappeable, technically that is unlimited memory.
Second, the phone runs hot when browsing the internet and also using GPS actively (GPS when in flight mode).
As a media device it features second to none audio quality (with good encoding and headphones it sounds incredible), and a truly amazing screen for photo viewing and video playback.
its ok is what i was looking for my dad very basic phone because he only use it to make phone calls no need an smart phone.
This is an excellent smartphone that my son is completely happy with after 3 weeks of use.
That person does not want or need any smartphone functionality, and for this purpose, this phone is a perfect replacement.
I recommend this phone to folks who are not interested in smart phone features.
Although not a "smart phone" this compact device is feature-packed with a camera for stills and video, a real music player, a real FM radio using your headset as its antenna, Bluetooth and USB, and data storage on a mini SD card.
So it should be listed as a smartphone.
As a first time smart phone user, this phone is perfect for me.


Clear phone call quality and easy to use Nokia OS.

With the updates the phone functions a little smoother.
Ever since I have used smart phones, nokia and symbian s60 has been my favorites, my last two phones being the n95-3 and the e71.
The OS is reliable, stable, very easy to use, and the battery life is pretty decent.
This phone is incompatible with MMS messaging, which your friends with smartphones may use from time to time.
I mention this because it is hard to communicate back and forth.

Okay but seriously I love this thing, I bought this to replace a ( Nokia C3 touch and Type ) which has unbelievably tiny keys This one however is for me the phone of my dreams it is very easy to use and for it's compact size is loaded with tons of functionsMeasurementsLength 7 inches.
Too bad because I like the simple model, the screen is easy to read and I can carry it in my pocket.
The full digital keyboard is easy to use with the stylus (a bit tough for those of us with fat fingers.
Easy to use, practical and so fast.
It's pretty easy to use for someone who has never had a touch screen before, and even has a help screen in every section plus tip video clips.
What's more is the variety of apps available for the phone, I can recommend a few that I have found quite useful: Photo Browser, Handy Shell, Paint Pad, Phone Torch, Opera Mini, AccuWeather, QuickOffice, GoogleMaps and Fring.


The positives, clear bright screen, fairly fast, Wifi, decent picture quality.
After i broke my focus I bought from att, I tried to save a little money buying from amazon, i bought my replacement from blutekusa, it came fast like they said and in a different box then at&t woulda came in, after two weeks i tried to plug it into the computer and it said device was malfunctioning, they sent me a new one as said, second came with no plug for the wall outlet charging and after two days it wont stop turning on and off.
PROS:It will charge fast.

It's fast and app storage only limited by the size of the sd card.
It is, however, fast.
You will need to connect a fast charger to the base (instead of the phone).
The phone is great to hold, looks nice, works fast and smooth.
Alpha is much faster.
The camera is better, the processor is faster and I don't have the dead spots for service that I had with my iphone.
I liked the version Samsung China has wireless charger, 3 gb of ran, is fast I have no problem with it for the moment.
Pairs up fast and easy to my moto bluetooths.
The shipping of the phone was very fast and even earlier than expected.
Performance: 4/5It is fast enough.

Works fast without lags.
