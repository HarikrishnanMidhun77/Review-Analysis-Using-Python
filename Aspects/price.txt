 For the price, I don't think you can ask for much more than that!
 At this price I bought 2 more
Another very good phone charger that does the job and has a  very affordable price that anyone can afford  to buy it
 For the low price having an extra USB charger this works great
 For this price, the charger is great
If you need a good charger for a cheap price

This Charger is awesome! First of all I wasn't expecting it until between 12/12  and 12/17, but it arrived on 12/11,So That was a plus for me! Second, I was kinda skeptical about purchasing it because it says that its for a Galaxy S and Blackberry so that can mean a lot of things! but I figured what the heck its cheap, so what can I loose!  Well, I just got it today and decided to give it a try at work on my Galaxy S4,  it charged  from 80%  to 100%  in about 7 minutes!! Yes i timed it!  and also the cord is long which is a plus for me!  So if your looking for a fast charger with a long cord and not to mention a great price, this is the one!!update:  not sure what the other reviewer meant by saying these are poor quality chargers, because I've had mine for a little over 2 weeks and it's still going strong!!  Love this charger  especially  for the length!!

  it chargers the phone fast and the price is great!  Highly Recommended product!
 They both have Samsung Galaxy phones and needed a car charger so being the OEM fanboy I am, I swooped up on a couple of these for them while remaining slightly skeptical of what was actually going to show up in the mail at this price
 Can't go wrong with the price and certainly can't argue with the benefits of OEM vs
 I highly recommend this car charger and thanks for the great price!
 I bought some other cheap lame one and will never go back
 If they ever have anything is stock, it is cheap junk that does not last
 I got this cord thru amazon for a fraction of the price I usually pay for the junk at that big national store
 I also bought at the same time 2 other cheaper charger cords thru amazon that work perfectly
 This is a great car charger, and it does not cost near as much as the junk you get at the local store--not to mention this is the Samsung brand charger verses their junk
luving it  right now will last about 4 mo so you cant beat the price for it I got 4 of them
I needed a car charger and this was very affordable and it worksgreat! The same thing from the store was three times the price
  This charger is working as expected, charges the phone fine and seems like a quality product, not flimsy and cheap feeling like some chargers I have ordered in the past
First, this is kind of cheap-looking, but I did try to buy the cheapest OEM car charger I could for my phone, so that's forgiveable
 Most chargers for cell phones are cheaply made
 For the price and really just needing a cord it is a good value but I am very disappointed with the false markings as OEM when it is certainly not
I thought this would be a Samsung product but look like a cheap counterfiet
 I'm not upset because it was very inexpensive but maybe you should spend a little more and buy a better product off amazon
it's a charger for dirt cheap and the shipping wasn't more than the item
  It is most definitely a good buy for the price!
works good with our phones, better actually than the charger that came with one of the phones initially , great price
 The micro usb is useless it looks and acts cheaply made, and dose not fit well in to ports an either end will periodically stop working and my phone will freeze and turn off periodically as well
 Why is it that all of the different companies that sell chargers on Amazon can get the plug part of the charger right but not the micro usb cord? The cord is cheap and not the original cord that comes with the other part of the charger
 Maybe, a 2 21/2 foot cord? And its of a cheaper quality than the part of the charger that the micro usb plugs into
 Good price and i recommend it
 Can't beat the price
Not Many HTC one battery cases for sale and this one is pretty good for the price
5 stars and 5 if the price was $5 cheaper
5 stars and 5 if the price was $5 cheaper
For such a good price, this is just the right deal
 the price is unbeatable and the product works like advertised
i was raving to a friend about how amazon has great phone cases and how cheap they are and bought him this
 good buy for the price
 Overall, I am extremely happy with the purchase, especially for so cheap
 It does fit nice so I gave it 2 stars, but bad opening for my phone will be costly
  i wound up buying a two piece case that cost about $20 from a local store
 Well for the price i think it is ok
I was looking for a cheap skin case and was not willing to pay a hefty amount for the case at least for the initial period after buying my unlocked galaxy s II
 It is cheap than when i saw in a store
  I cannot say enough about Amazon, they are realistic in their prices, knowing that people do not have that kind of money to pay for a wire,,for 14 or 28 dollars
  I have purchased some cheaper cables that would not transmit data between my computer and my Blackberry Storm 9530
I bought this micro usb cable because it was cheap, and that it is
I purchased 3 of these cables because they were cheap and got good reviews
 great value for the price
A good inexpensive cable that works like the original
The cable worked great with the pre if you need an extra one, but I suggest purchasing the whole unit--plug and all, not just the cable, because with shipping and handling it gets to be the same price
I was initially leary about purchasing this item due to the extremely low price and to have free shipping also, but I needed a wall charger since Motorola only includes a car charger with their wireless car phone speakers
  So I took a chance (due to the low price and free shipping) and was pleasantly surprised
, and at less than 25% of the cost
  great price and no complaints with receipt of material in either packaging or transit time
I only trust HTC accessories for HTC phones having bad luck with aftermarket products that are cheaper, but cheap is expensive

I was really impressed by the price and was very excited when it arrived
this product is great value for the price
It works and is a good value for the price compared to the retail stores
These were really inexpensive and they work just like I wanted them to
Disappointed at how cheap they are and doubt they were designed for newer devices
Looking at the price, I ordered 2 of these
Initially it is a great charger at a great price
 For the price though I guess it's still not a bad deal
  It was a great value considering how much they cost in stores
  This little charger works well and it was a lot less expensive than Sprint store
 Lesson learned,cheap things break too quickly
 Phone companies just got cheap and decided to stop sending phones with a power cable AND a data cable separately, but in the end, you will go out and get yourself a standard power cable
quality-wise and price-wise
I love that this has a longer cord!  It fits great in my phone!  Very pleased you have it so cheap!  Thanks!
Yeah, I know the shipping & handling was much more expensive than the charger was but I needed a charger that connected and this one fit nice and snug so I am able to charge my phone while sitting at my desk in my home office at my computer looking for work
which is an all day job huh?  LOL!  Wow, I wish I could write reviews for a living wouldn't that be nice?  I think the total price of $$3
at the price I didn't expect perfection, and at Sellers defense,I have not contacted them
I was a bit wary about buying this headset in used condition, but was lured by the half-price price tag when compared to a new headset
This headset works fine, but I expected somewhat better sound quality for the price
 Product is as described and price is right
  Im not too concerned because of the price
 They are reasonably priced
 Not a bad item for the price
 Apple was charging a lot and this battery did the job perfectly for a lot cheaper and came with the tools
 Got my money back and bought one for 1/2 the price and that one works great! Maybe I just got a defective battery
If I had one minor nitpick, it would be that a color-coding of the handles would be a great help, but really, this is an excellent value for the price
Seem to be high quality compare with the cost
  Fair price
 Love this product! great price and quality
Could have been better for the price and wait time
  This set is a nice value for the price
It is chinesse(like almost everything in this world LOL) but they are really well done, and for the price they are a bargain
Really poor quality tweezer bent like nothing screw drivers made of cheap plastic adhesive removing tool again cheap plastic you get what you pay for would not recommend to anyone who is trying to perform phone surgery
 At the price, there was no way I was going to beat a set of Stanleys
i have used this kit to fix a bunch of cell phones  and price is right and tools work great
 I can't say that it wasn't user error, but they seemed very cheap
 After lamenting on whether or not to buy some of the cheaper options available, I went with the &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; cliche and paid for the extra assurance that I was not getting a cheap knockoff
 The price was the thing that did it for me
 Great price!!
Great tools, I still use them and I like the quality, great price as well
 High quality materials at a low price
the Torx screwdrivers were great, the tweesers were substandard, and the spluger was very cheap, mine broke the first time i used it
  For the price you cannot expect high quality
These were a supper price and while not supper strong they will do the job and you get a lot for your money
For the price, you cannot beat this little Stanley screwdriver set
  That alone made it worth the Amazon price and this little kit has a permanent place in my range shooting bag
 they sell bigger sets on here for cheaper, but made by a different company
 VERY cheaply made
  This was well rated, inexpensive, and in a case
  Also, while I enjoyed the product I feel it may be slightly over priced for what you get
  At this price, I can afford it
these are the very best quality at a AWESOME price
 over a cell phone company price
  I'd return this except it would cost more to ship than it is worth
Great for the price
 I had to go with 5 stars because you can't beat the price for something that works this well
 I get better sound out of this one than I did from my other one that I originally bought for more than twice the price
 I didn't believe it, so I figured, "I'll pay for that and when it doesn't arrive on time I'll get my money back for the shipping cost" (I mean come on, it was 300 miles south of me!!)
  It was way better than that last stupid cheap one I bought at best buy that the cord wore out on after 2 months
 This one works fantastic for the price
- Does not look cheap
 It looks more decent than other cassette adapters I have that costs 20$- The coiled cord is great and much less clutter
Avoid at all costs!I scanned past the negative reviews since this product had a few really positive reviews with a lot of helpful votes
I would like to say that this is not cheap junk, but it did nothing at all for my cell reception
and sure enough I was surprise that I get more bars reception  in my cell than I had before and the price is right
com has not refunded my purchase price
Right now, this phone is one of the best, without the 300+ pricetag
This is an excellent replacement battery, it fit just fine and the price was amazing
If I'd bought this battery where I bought the cell phone, it would've cost much, much more
  You get what you pay for, but I don't need to use it very often, so it is compatible with my phone and is easy to use--not much you can mess up!  If you need one that you will use a lot, you may want to buy something more advanced, but this is a good backup and was very inexpensive
This has to be the cheapest headset I have ever purchased, yet the best small headset ever made
 I've ordered several, and you'd pay 3 times the price in a bog-box electronics store
 Well worth the price
Overall, it's a great headset for the price
 Not as good as my cheap jawbone, but then people usually complain they can't hear me as well on that one
 Otherwise, worth the price
 It was rather cheap, I ended up giving it away because it was cheaply made!
  I was very happy to see that these were still available and at a much better price than what I paid way back
More importantly, the point is that the thing that goes in your ear is a cheap, thin little foam pad that will wear out very quickly
  No box, no packing - not even some cheap bubble wrap and a rubber band, just chucked it into a bag
  I realize it's super cheap but it should last a month
This headset has the disadvantage of having a wire, but it's also about 1/20th the price of a Bluetooth headset, and won't give you cancer
 The price was substantially the same (per unit)
But, as far as the product itself goes, it's perfectly functional for the purpose--cheap branded headset (for me, specifically to complement a BT set, which this one replaces when charge runs out)
 I've had a number of cheap or free headsets (often even enclosed with a phone) and virtually all of them have awful raspy and tinny sound
 It was a cheap ATT/Nokia handset to replace a lost phone so I am not surprised about compatibility issues
I took one start off, because I think that these headsets should be ~100 or less for what we are getting, and this one was the best deal that I could find! The plastic housing on the charger unit could be sturdier f they are going to charge consumers these prices for must haves items like this
 I'll put my own inside, but for the price I think they could have included something
 Their customer service is really good, the features they offer on their web site are great, the prices for wireless modem and wireless web are incredibility great and the national calling price plans are very good compared to what I?ve seen elsewhere
  The Moto V600 is a much better phone, takes better pictures, gives you better clarity and reception, is smaller, and is much, much cheaper
 Otherwise it is a little pricey
  The phone employs java applications, so you can download programs to fit your needs from nextel, at a cost
Other than the high initial cost (I got it before they put in a promotion, duh), i really love this compact and stylish phone
 I own the cheaper Motorola (Nextel) i710
 The i860 gets as good a signal as the i710 (but its significantly more expensive too)
Other than signal strength compared to the cheaper and basically identical (except for external screen) i710, the i730 is a pretty good phone
  I could've chosen a smaller phone with a better camera, but not with a speakerphone, or with speakerphone, but not at this price
They look cheap but work great
 So that is a plus!**********************************These little adaptors look like they are well made and the price was right
If you have the space, this is an excellent converter and a solid price
 I have bought dedicated power adapters for laptop computers, but these are expensive and usually only work with a particular model laptop
 I should also note that Subaru sells its own 100-watt power inverter for my vehicle, but it costs about $300, while the Sabrent inverter is a small fraction of that amount
A very nice power inverter, especially for the price
