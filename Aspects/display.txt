When I connect it to my S2, the screen gets frozen and the cell behaves in a unusual (abnormal) way
 They are even more jealous when I tell them how much I paid for it! Great case, powers me up and VERY stylish
The raised edges protect the screens from falls
 The battery case looks stylish and charges me up
 However because of its large screen the phone dies quickly
my co-worker delayed in getting a case because he could not find one he liked, and broke the display screen, making his phone unusable

 I use this with my Nexus s 4g from sprint and although it does indeed charge my device it causes some major issues, such as screen lag, my computer not being able to recognize what kind of device this is, and causing my phone to constantly jump into car mode
plastic pry tool kinda sucks, but all the other tools in the kit are quite handy, helped me fix a broken screen on a $500 phone so saved a bit of cheddar there
 (See user uploaded photo that matches the description below)- 6 Torx type drivers, magnetic tip (T4,T5,T6,T7,T8,T10) (Orange handle, with blue cap)- 1 Philips driver, magnetic tip (black handle)- 1 Flat driver, magnetic tip (black handle)- 1 3-point driver, magnetic tip (clear red handle)- 2 tweezers (stainless steel, on blister packs)- 1 pry tool (dark green)I purchased this set to do some work on a Droid X (MB810), and they did the job well enough, except I had to carefully use the T4 instead of a T3 *very* carefully on 12 screws holding the screen assembly together
I got this to try and replace a screen, found out I'm not a phone repair person
  They were, however, better than the ones that came with the screen I ordered
  I lost the windscreen for the boom mic once and an email to them got me a set of windscreens in my mailbox, no charge
 Good product but i was getting the reel error on my tape display in my ford expedition
  After pressing more than a few keys, the screen would lock up and I needed to remove the battery to reset it
  Camera, color display, fully customizable
 Color display hard to see in bright daylight (but not impossible), it has frozen on me a few times, mostly with internet
  Highly recommend, might want to look into the T626 or T630 for better color display
Great display
  Seriously - Bluetooth, IR, good phone book features, nice color display (though it washes out if you are using polarized glasses)
 although you won't be able to see it on the external display, when you flip it open, you'll see that person's face
Another thing is that the external display is like a blue-green thing against a black background
 Also, the pictures that you can take by lookin at the external display will be a bluish-green color but when it's saved, and you look at it, it's in full color so no worries there
  It was a pretty color screen though 
  The phone doesn't squeak when squeezed, and all of the construction is tight (even the flip screen doesn't wiggle much)
  This phone is full featured, it isn't exactly a PDA phone, but it's software capability and 65k color screen make it perform many of the same functions as a PDA
Other than the high initial cost (I got it before they put in a promotion, duh), i really love this compact and stylish phone
 The only thing I can think of is some hardware added to give the i730 an external screen somehow interferes with the antennae hardware somehow
Other than signal strength compared to the cheaper and basically identical (except for external screen) i710, the i730 is a pretty good phone
 For me signal was more important that a silver case an an external screen but if you like those things the i730 is a decent phone to use
The screen is a little smaller but the brilliant color makes up for it,the sound is as good as the other phones I have had
Clear beautiful color screen and camera
The front screen went out on my S105 and T-Mobile wanted me to buy another phone since my warrenty was up
-Nice, clear display
  The first is an intuitive text entry method where the phone guesses the words that you are trying to type and displays them on the screen for you to choose
