 Came in scuffed with paint and the pieces will not click in together
 Also if it wasn't in three click in pieces
Protects VERY well the phone as well as the camera lens there is not one single part of the phone touching the surface of the table when i leave it there
  The charger appears to as well made as the other after market chargers I purchased previously for my e-book reader, PDA, camera, etc
) The box suggests these screwdrivers can be used for repairing eyeglasses, cameras, watches, fishing reels, hobbies, electronics, and small appliances
I bought this kit to remove the cameras out of my HTC 4G LTE and I didn't have any problems except for removing the small plastic portion on the bottom rear side of the phone
  That alone made it worth the Amazon price and this little kit has a permanent place in my range shooting bag
 However, the product made a quite audible (at low automobile speeds) click-click-click
 The Maxell didn't go click-click-click, but it whistled, too
Cons:- The only thing I can think of is it still makes noticeable clicking sound while in the cassette
 There is a little bit of a clicking sound that appears once it starts playing, but with road nose and the general nose of the car, it is a non-issue
  The camera is good enough for a cell phone
very durable, water tight, use this in my backpack to keep medical supplies dry, the clamps hold tight with a solid click when shut
This phone is amazingly small and light for a camera phone; it even has a flashlight/flash
 I can't put the phone in a standard cell phone holder for the car because the camera button is on the side and it's a long key, the holder makes the camera come on
2) The camera now has a flash as well as a zoom
 Also, you can do multi-shot with this as well as put lots of different kind of frames to your pictures
  It's the best Nextel has offered yet, although there's rumor that a camera phone is coming out soon
I will not hash over the things that many other wrote in their reviews, but mainly will focus on the problems that I've had with this phone over the course of 1 year that I've had it
 Very poor fundamentals - but it looks cool and has a (very useless, but still cool) camera
Clear beautiful color screen and camera
  I chose the v300 b/c of the extra gadgets (mainly the camera and speakerphone) even thought the rep said samsung users have a hard time getting used to the Motorola OS
  I could've chosen a smaller phone with a better camera, but not with a speakerphone, or with speakerphone, but not at this price
My favorite phone is still the Sanyo VM-4500 video camera walkie-talkie speakerphone cell phone for Sprint PCS
I used the adapters primarily in Denmark and Norway, they worked great and gave me no problems charging iPod, iPhone, iPad, camera batteries, etc
 I used it with two of my AC-powered camera battery chargers and a AA battery charger:Canon G10 battery charger - 14 wattsNikon D3200 battery charger - 20 wattsMaha AA battery charger - 16 wattsI also used the inverter to charge my HP laptop while using the laptop
