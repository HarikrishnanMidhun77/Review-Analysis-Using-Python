recommend it highly for anyone with a microUSB phone
 The micro usb is useless it looks and acts cheaply made, and dose not fit well in to ports an either end will periodically stop working and my phone will freeze and turn off periodically as well
I would like to start off by saying that this product is what I ordered and I have no complaints about shipping or the condition of the product when it came to my house, the problem I do have is the micro usb cable that comes with the charger
 Why is it that all of the different companies that sell chargers on Amazon can get the plug part of the charger right but not the micro usb cord? The cord is cheap and not the original cord that comes with the other part of the charger
 Maybe, a 2 21/2 foot cord? And its of a cheaper quality than the part of the charger that the micro usb plugs into
Other power cases muffled the speaker sound
 The only difference that I can see is the noise cancelling microphone is blocked

  I'm in USA, I ordered the cover for Galaxy II that i bought from USA, the cover didn't fit, and the speaker location is different from the phone
 I wish the top margin (above the earphone) can wrap down by a few mm
I bought this micro usb cable because it was cheap, and that it is
I was initially leary about purchasing this item due to the extremely low price and to have free shipping also, but I needed a wall charger since Motorola only includes a car charger with their wireless car phone speakers
  I charged my Motorola speaker without any problems
but it's a OEM micro usb cable none the less and works perfectly on any micro usb device I plugged it into
  However, I'm not a fan of how long it seems to take to charge to full charge, nor how it atomically &#34;stops&#34; charging at certain times on it's own
I have the x50 headset and she has the voyage, it works on both really well
I was a bit wary about buying this headset in used condition, but was lured by the half-price price tag when compared to a new headset
 I envisioned all sorts of shortcomings, but when it arrived I was astounded at the excellent condition of the headset
I love that this headset stays firmly on the head with the band and firmly on the ear with just the ear piece
  The sound quality is great, and the ability to mute the mic is the main reason I bought this
  Usually I can make it better by adjusting the mic volume (another nice feature) or by moving the mic away from my mouth
  The mic is always strong enough to pick up my voice, and I never have complaints about people not being able to hear me
  The best part is the adjustable amplifier - if I have distortion from the sound out of my cell phone, I can increase or decrease both the output from the cell phone itself and the amplifier on the headset, and I usually can maximize the sound and minimize distortion
Love this type of headset
  It includes a leatherette &#34;cup&#34; for the ear speaker, but I usually don't even use it, finding it comfortable even without it
This headset works fine, but I expected somewhat better sound quality for the price
 Not sure if this would allow you to initiate a call on the cell phone, however, which is what I am really looking for from a headset since bluetooth headset sound quality is so poor
This is a decent quality headset and sound quality from the ear piece is standard Plantronics quality (i
 Some people have observed that I sound a little distant with this headset while plugged into the wireless XBOX controller, but repositioning the mic to be as close to my mouth as possible fixes it

There is an adjustable mic sensitivity switch on the plug, but this doesn't seem to make any difference to people at the far end of the conversation
 It's not as cool as the wireless headsets (bluetooth etc) but it doesn't take batteries, doesn't have to be recharged and isn't subject to interference
  I unplugged headset and switched to using my cell, and they said the problem went away, so unfortunately problem seems to be with this headset
I've been buying these headsets for several years, recommending them to friends and associates and now I'm buying them as gifts for the headset challenged
These are wonderful headsets
 And the microphones are simply top-notch
 And the microphones are simply top-notch
I've tried and returned at least 5 headsets ranging from $15 to $150
 This one was typical of the others that I returned, low volume on the earpiece and low quality microphone
 This one was typical of the others that I returned, low volume on the earpiece and low quality microphone
 I finally ended up with a Panasonic TCA60 for about $19 which is very loud and sounds great on both ends
A nice change for me - having a headset that doesn't slip and slide, fall out of my ear, or buzz
 The only time is doesn't work well is when the listener is also wearing a headset, and even then, I suspect that it is the fault of the listener's headset and not mine
The only problem with this headset is that people you are talking to will have trouble hearing you
The screw drivers have a free rolling top to make pressure, and the body is rellay good, nice grip and 3 lobules ergonomics
 Now I can wear my Jawbone all day! Aliph should include these with the Jawbone headsets
I bought these to use with my Jawbone Era bluetooth headset
I got these for my jawbone headset
On the recommendations of a few reviewers, I tried these gels for my Jawbone headset
 Unfortunately, they did not fit well and came off every time I took the headset off
 That was too bad because they did seem somewhat comfortable and did direct the sound into my ear for a louder and clearer sound
 They would probably work well on some other headsets
 If they fit your headset then I would give these gels a try
  Unfotunately after a few days they started rejecting my headset
I purchased these because the original ear pieces from jabra were OK but left me pushing on my headset constantly trying to get it in my ear more
I found a size that fit my ear perfectly and was able to use the headset without the earband which was a surprise
  Only reason I am giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is that it takes quite a bit of adjusting and finesse to get the gel on the headset
But overall a great product and the sound is now channelled directly into my ear so I don't have to keep pushing my headset in to hear
people should buy headsets to fit these things bc they are so essential
A must have for any headset that will fit them
I bought these so my headset would be more comfortable
Purchased the Jawbone bluetooth headset
  I lost the windscreen for the boom mic once and an email to them got me a set of windscreens in my mailbox, no charge
The microphone will capture sound just fine, despite the short arm

 Playing mp3s from a phone or player sounds more clear and louder than if I were to tune in a radio station
works great in my 2002 honda accord!  other adapters have either gimped the frequency range or only come out of one speaker
I was using an FM modulator, but didn't like that with my iPhone, it would create feedback in the car speakers, so I decided to switch over to a cassette adapter
my car had to get used to it as it is old but after a few try's haven't had any issues with it since and it just plays the music on and on now but i will note it doesn't sound beautiful might be my cars speakers though not sure
 For those that don't know, the device clips to your earlobe after placing the speaker in your ear
 If you want to go hands free without going the bluetooth route, get this headset
 The mic picks up great! Using this thing all the time now and keeping spares in the car for when bluetooth gets fussy
This has to be the cheapest headset I have ever purchased, yet the best small headset ever made
 It says its made by plantronics in the description but the headset itself says verizon on the side so I'm not sure what the deal is with that but I know that it works great
 So if you're looking for a nice regular headset for xbox live because the microsoft headsets break all the time or for a cell phone, buy this headset
 So if you're looking for a nice regular headset for xbox live because the microsoft headsets break all the time or for a cell phone, buy this headset
Overall, it's a great headset for the price
I have a dull voice and this is by far the best headset I have that helps people hear me clearly (I actually have an older version of the same headset, so I have two)
As with so many Plantronics headsets that I have owned, the problem is with the connector jack, the movement of the wire causes the headset to loose contact with the plug-in jack, which at that point they are ready for the garbage bin
This is actually a lightweight comfortable phone headset
  Also, the speaker part is covered by some foam that picks up ear wax and gets dirty extremely quickly - not an item you would want to share with someone
I got sick of xbox 360 microphones breaking, so I decided to buy this to see if it would work

 I got sound and the microphone worked but I got a lot of feedback and echo
 I got sound and the microphone worked but I got a lot of feedback and echo
This headset would not stay in my ear no matter how hard I tried
  I like the fact that it is small, that it sounds OK, and that the person on the line could hear me OK (not great) But I could not figure out how to keep it in my ear without holding it, which defeats the purpose of having a headset!! I ordered 4 of them, they were about $3 apiece with shipping, and the first two are buzzy and could not be used
 I went to an over the head headset by Jensen, and am VERY pleased!
I purchased one of these headsets many years ago and was very happy with it
  Highly recommend to anyone who prefers the corded headset
  I purchased this headset for my mother and she has not complained about it yet!
Sound was fine through the headset, however the Mic did not work at all
I have purchased 4 different Jabra headsets, because they are the most comfortable and easy to hear with, but they have poor microphone quality

  It's comfortable and fits in your ear, and the sound quality (especially the noise cancellation on the mic) is *stellar* - you can be driving down a noisy freeway and the person listening to you will *never* know you're in the car
I tried several Bluetooth headsets and was thoroughly unimpressed: you have to charge them, they add latency, they add extra compression artifacts, and the audio clips in and out on you
This headset has the disadvantage of having a wire, but it's also about 1/20th the price of a Bluetooth headset, and won't give you cancer
5mm (so you can plug in a headset or just headphones)
  So, once I got a smartphone, I ended up buying half a dozen adapters, because I love this headset so much
I got a pair of Plantronics-branded headsets in Verizon OEM packaging (plastic bag), each coming with a "universal" adapter (micro-USB male to 2

 However, the other photos show the same headset, but without the control button--not a different button, but nothing at all! This made me wonder what is being sold as MX150
But, as far as the product itself goes, it's perfectly functional for the purpose--cheap branded headset (for me, specifically to complement a BT set, which this one replaces when charge runs out)
 I've had a number of cheap or free headsets (often even enclosed with a phone) and virtually all of them have awful raspy and tinny sound
 That's not what I want in a headset, even for $3
 But I needed an emergency headset and this one fit the bill
 The sound quality is far superior to no-name headsets--on both ends
 It's better than an average Sony/Ericsson handset--I always add a headset to those when using them since Sony deliberately puts crappy speakers into Ericsson phones to make you buy their headsets

 When traveling through NY or DE or any other state that requires no-hands on the phone, it is essential to be quickly disconnect and replace a discharged BT headset
  Highly recommended headset regardless!
Like most people I have owned multiple styles of headsets and had varying degrees of success with them
  The headset unit gives you call answer and end control with your fingertips as well as volume and mute control
  It would operate for up to 8 hours but it has a desktop control stand that charged the headset while I am in a meeting or at lunch
I used the Plantronics HL 10 Handset Lifter and by touching the button on the headset I could answer the phone remotely with ease
  The headset is extremely light and comfortable and the phone transmission is digitally encrypted for security and privacy
I took one start off, because I think that these headsets should be ~100 or less for what we are getting, and this one was the best deal that I could find! The plastic housing on the charger unit could be sturdier f they are going to charge consumers these prices for must haves items like this
 I plugged it into my VoIP phone and away I went! There was something in the description about &#34;USB,&#34; but this unit is hooks up to the phones headset port via a regular old telephone jacks input
I purchased FIVE wireless headsets around the same time for my office workers
  She kept getting a feedback sound in the headset even when not on a call
  I dont know if it was something in the walls making it have feedback, but we couldnt get the problem to stop so she went back to a wired headset
I have been using the headset she had problems with, and i constantly have that annoying pulsing feedback
Problems with 2 out of 5 headsets seems like pretty poor odds to me
I've had this headset for many years (at least 5+, but I can't remember exactly when I got it)
  If I don't place the headset in just right, and jiggle it a little to make sure it has a good connection, it doesn't charge
  Not a tremeendous problem except for those rare occassions when I forget to double check when I put it in the charger, and I end up with a dead headset
-There is a very noticeable buzz in the line if you use the phone handset, which means you MUST use the headset
  The simple solution is to just always use the headset, which is fine, but
on those occassions where the headset is dead (see above), you're left with no great option
  When that happens, I end up having to use the speakerphone on my phone until the headset is charged again
  When that happens, I end up having to use the speakerphone on my phone until the headset is charged again
  Not a really big deal, but then I get people asking "talk me off speaker phone", and I have to explain to them that I can't
 I like to use a speaker type hands free kit in the car so I don't have to look at the phone to answer, talk or dial
 It rings nice and loud and putting it on vibrate is easy

  I chose the v300 b/c of the extra gadgets (mainly the camera and speakerphone) even thought the rep said samsung users have a hard time getting used to the Motorola OS
  Most of them are pretty standard to cell phones these days, but a few things are worth commenting on:-Great speakerphone
  Very loud and clear sounding, both ways
  It's very loud if you don't already have the phone on silent/vibrate only
  Basically, to quickly change to phone from a loud ring to silent--say in a theater--you have to make a loud noise
  I could've chosen a smaller phone with a better camera, but not with a speakerphone, or with speakerphone, but not at this price
  What I really like (after playing with a friend's) is the loud ringtones, the good reception (despite the lack of GSM coverage in Brooklyn), and the great styling
My favorite phone is still the Sanyo VM-4500 video camera walkie-talkie speakerphone cell phone for Sprint PCS
Works as it is supposed to, lightweight, compact, and very economical
  I replace this unit with my old earphone
  "Now your voice sounds muffled", he said, "and I hear that TV now loud and clear"
  My old earphone almost seems to exaggerate the background noise
I started using this headset two days ago
  My only complaint is that it comes with a case, yet the headset doesn't fit in it without bending the microphone stalk and I'm not comfortable doing that

  Why not give a case that accomodates it and its accessories?UPDATE 4/30/08:  After months of using this headset, I have to say I find it mildly annoying
  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone shopping for a headset
  I really bought it because it was so hard to find a headset compatible with my AT&T; 8525
The sound of this headset is excellent, as advertised
recommend it highly for anyone with a microUSB phone
 The micro usb is useless it looks and acts cheaply made, and dose not fit well in to ports an either end will periodically stop working and my phone will freeze and turn off periodically as well

  Not a tremeendous problem except for those rare occassions when I forget to double check when I put it in the charger, and I end up with a dead headset
-There is a very noticeable buzz in the line if you use the phone handset, which means you MUST use the headset
  The simple solution is to just always use the headset, which is fine, but
on those occassions where the headset is dead (see above), you're left with no great option
  When that happens, I end up having to use the speakerphone on my phone until the headset is charged again
  When that happens, I end up having to use the speakerphone on my phone until the headset is charged again
  Not a really big deal, but then I get people asking "talk me off speaker phone", and I have to explain to them that I can't
 I like to use a speaker type hands free kit in the car so I don't have to look at the phone to answer, talk or dial
 It rings nice and loud and putting it on vibrate is easy

  I chose the v300 b/c of the extra gadgets (mainly the camera and speakerphone) even thought the rep said samsung users have a hard time getting used to the Motorola OS
  Most of them are pretty standard to cell phones these days, but a few things are worth commenting on:-Great speakerphone
  Very loud and clear sounding, both ways
  It's very loud if you don't already have the phone on silent/vibrate only
  Basically, to quickly change to phone from a loud ring to silent--say in a theater--you have to make a loud noise
  I could've chosen a smaller phone with a better camera, but not with a speakerphone, or with speakerphone, but not at this price
  What I really like (after playing with a friend's) is the loud ringtones, the good reception (despite the lack of GSM coverage in Brooklyn), and the great styling
My favorite phone is still the Sanyo VM-4500 video camera walkie-talkie speakerphone cell phone for Sprint PCS
Works as it is supposed to, lightweight, compact, and very economical
  I replace this unit with my old earphone
  "Now your voice sounds muffled", he said, "and I hear that TV now loud and clear"
  My old earphone almost seems to exaggerate the background noise
I started using this headset two days ago
  My only complaint is that it comes with a case, yet the headset doesn't fit in it without bending the microphone stalk and I'm not comfortable doing that

  My only complaint is that it comes with a case, yet the headset doesn't fit in it without bending the microphone stalk and I'm not comfortable doing that
  Why not give a case that accomodates it and its accessories?UPDATE 4/30/08:  After months of using this headset, I have to say I find it mildly annoying
  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone shopping for a headset
  I really bought it because it was so hard to find a headset compatible with my AT&T; 8525
The sound of this headset is excellent, as advertised
recommend it highly for anyone with a microUSB phone
 The micro usb is useless it looks and acts cheaply made, and dose not fit well in to ports an either end will periodically stop working and my phone will freeze and turn off periodically as well
I would like to start off by saying that this product is what I ordered and I have no complaints about shipping or the condition of the product when it came to my house, the problem I do have is the micro usb cable that comes with the charger
 Why is it that all of the different companies that sell chargers on Amazon can get the plug part of the charger right but not the micro usb cord? The cord is cheap and not the original cord that comes with the other part of the charger
 Maybe, a 2 21/2 foot cord? And its of a cheaper quality than the part of the charger that the micro usb plugs into
Other power cases muffled the speaker sound
 The only difference that I can see is the noise cancelling microphone is blocked

  I'm in USA, I ordered the cover for Galaxy II that i bought from USA, the cover didn't fit, and the speaker location is different from the phone
 I wish the top margin (above the earphone) can wrap down by a few mm
I bought this micro usb cable because it was cheap, and that it is
I was initially leary about purchasing this item due to the extremely low price and to have free shipping also, but I needed a wall charger since Motorola only includes a car charger with their wireless car phone speakers
  I charged my Motorola speaker without any problems
but it's a OEM micro usb cable none the less and works perfectly on any micro usb device I plugged it into
  However, I'm not a fan of how long it seems to take to charge to full charge, nor how it atomically &#34;stops&#34; charging at certain times on it's own
I have the x50 headset and she has the voyage, it works on both really well
I was a bit wary about buying this headset in used condition, but was lured by the half-price price tag when compared to a new headset
 I envisioned all sorts of shortcomings, but when it arrived I was astounded at the excellent condition of the headset
I love that this headset stays firmly on the head with the band and firmly on the ear with just the ear piece
  The sound quality is great, and the ability to mute the mic is the main reason I bought this
  Usually I can make it better by adjusting the mic volume (another nice feature) or by moving the mic away from my mouth
  The mic is always strong enough to pick up my voice, and I never have complaints about people not being able to hear me
  The best part is the adjustable amplifier - if I have distortion from the sound out of my cell phone, I can increase or decrease both the output from the cell phone itself and the amplifier on the headset, and I usually can maximize the sound and minimize distortion
Love this type of headset
  It includes a leatherette &#34;cup&#34; for the ear speaker, but I usually don't even use it, finding it comfortable even without it
This headset works fine, but I expected somewhat better sound quality for the price
 Not sure if this would allow you to initiate a call on the cell phone, however, which is what I am really looking for from a headset since bluetooth headset sound quality is so poor
This is a decent quality headset and sound quality from the ear piece is standard Plantronics quality (i
 Some people have observed that I sound a little distant with this headset while plugged into the wireless XBOX controller, but repositioning the mic to be as close to my mouth as possible fixes it
 Some people have observed that I sound a little distant with this headset while plugged into the wireless XBOX controller, but repositioning the mic to be as close to my mouth as possible fixes it
There is an adjustable mic sensitivity switch on the plug, but this doesn't seem to make any difference to people at the far end of the conversation
 It's not as cool as the wireless headsets (bluetooth etc) but it doesn't take batteries, doesn't have to be recharged and isn't subject to interference
  I unplugged headset and switched to using my cell, and they said the problem went away, so unfortunately problem seems to be with this headset
I've been buying these headsets for several years, recommending them to friends and associates and now I'm buying them as gifts for the headset challenged
These are wonderful headsets
 And the microphones are simply top-notch

I've tried and returned at least 5 headsets ranging from $15 to $150
 This one was typical of the others that I returned, low volume on the earpiece and low quality microphone
 This one was typical of the others that I returned, low volume on the earpiece and low quality microphone
 I finally ended up with a Panasonic TCA60 for about $19 which is very loud and sounds great on both ends
A nice change for me - having a headset that doesn't slip and slide, fall out of my ear, or buzz
 The only time is doesn't work well is when the listener is also wearing a headset, and even then, I suspect that it is the fault of the listener's headset and not mine
The only problem with this headset is that people you are talking to will have trouble hearing you
The screw drivers have a free rolling top to make pressure, and the body is rellay good, nice grip and 3 lobules ergonomics
 Now I can wear my Jawbone all day! Aliph should include these with the Jawbone headsets
I bought these to use with my Jawbone Era bluetooth headset
I got these for my jawbone headset
On the recommendations of a few reviewers, I tried these gels for my Jawbone headset
 Unfortunately, they did not fit well and came off every time I took the headset off
 That was too bad because they did seem somewhat comfortable and did direct the sound into my ear for a louder and clearer sound
 They would probably work well on some other headsets
 If they fit your headset then I would give these gels a try
  Unfotunately after a few days they started rejecting my headset
I purchased these because the original ear pieces from jabra were OK but left me pushing on my headset constantly trying to get it in my ear more
I found a size that fit my ear perfectly and was able to use the headset without the earband which was a surprise
  Only reason I am giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is that it takes quite a bit of adjusting and finesse to get the gel on the headset
But overall a great product and the sound is now channelled directly into my ear so I don't have to keep pushing my headset in to hear
people should buy headsets to fit these things bc they are so essential
A must have for any headset that will fit them
I bought these so my headset would be more comfortable
Purchased the Jawbone bluetooth headset
  I lost the windscreen for the boom mic once and an email to them got me a set of windscreens in my mailbox, no charge
The microphone will capture sound just fine, despite the short arm

 Playing mp3s from a phone or player sounds more clear and louder than if I were to tune in a radio station
works great in my 2002 honda accord!  other adapters have either gimped the frequency range or only come out of one speaker
I was using an FM modulator, but didn't like that with my iPhone, it would create feedback in the car speakers, so I decided to switch over to a cassette adapter
my car had to get used to it as it is old but after a few try's haven't had any issues with it since and it just plays the music on and on now but i will note it doesn't sound beautiful might be my cars speakers though not sure
 For those that don't know, the device clips to your earlobe after placing the speaker in your ear
 If you want to go hands free without going the bluetooth route, get this headset
 The mic picks up great! Using this thing all the time now and keeping spares in the car for when bluetooth gets fussy
This has to be the cheapest headset I have ever purchased, yet the best small headset ever made
 It says its made by plantronics in the description but the headset itself says verizon on the side so I'm not sure what the deal is with that but I know that it works great
 So if you're looking for a nice regular headset for xbox live because the microsoft headsets break all the time or for a cell phone, buy this headset
 So if you're looking for a nice regular headset for xbox live because the microsoft headsets break all the time or for a cell phone, buy this headset
Overall, it's a great headset for the price
I have a dull voice and this is by far the best headset I have that helps people hear me clearly (I actually have an older version of the same headset, so I have two)
As with so many Plantronics headsets that I have owned, the problem is with the connector jack, the movement of the wire causes the headset to loose contact with the plug-in jack, which at that point they are ready for the garbage bin
This is actually a lightweight comfortable phone headset
  Also, the speaker part is covered by some foam that picks up ear wax and gets dirty extremely quickly - not an item you would want to share with someone
I got sick of xbox 360 microphones breaking, so I decided to buy this to see if it would work

 I got sound and the microphone worked but I got a lot of feedback and echo
 I got sound and the microphone worked but I got a lot of feedback and echo
This headset would not stay in my ear no matter how hard I tried
  I like the fact that it is small, that it sounds OK, and that the person on the line could hear me OK (not great) But I could not figure out how to keep it in my ear without holding it, which defeats the purpose of having a headset!! I ordered 4 of them, they were about $3 apiece with shipping, and the first two are buzzy and could not be used
 I went to an over the head headset by Jensen, and am VERY pleased!
I purchased one of these headsets many years ago and was very happy with it
  Highly recommend to anyone who prefers the corded headset
  I purchased this headset for my mother and she has not complained about it yet!
Sound was fine through the headset, however the Mic did not work at all
I have purchased 4 different Jabra headsets, because they are the most comfortable and easy to hear with, but they have poor microphone quality

  It's comfortable and fits in your ear, and the sound quality (especially the noise cancellation on the mic) is *stellar* - you can be driving down a noisy freeway and the person listening to you will *never* know you're in the car
I tried several Bluetooth headsets and was thoroughly unimpressed: you have to charge them, they add latency, they add extra compression artifacts, and the audio clips in and out on you
This headset has the disadvantage of having a wire, but it's also about 1/20th the price of a Bluetooth headset, and won't give you cancer
5mm (so you can plug in a headset or just headphones)
  So, once I got a smartphone, I ended up buying half a dozen adapters, because I love this headset so much
I got a pair of Plantronics-branded headsets in Verizon OEM packaging (plastic bag), each coming with a "universal" adapter (micro-USB male to 2

 However, the other photos show the same headset, but without the control button--not a different button, but nothing at all! This made me wonder what is being sold as MX150
But, as far as the product itself goes, it's perfectly functional for the purpose--cheap branded headset (for me, specifically to complement a BT set, which this one replaces when charge runs out)
 I've had a number of cheap or free headsets (often even enclosed with a phone) and virtually all of them have awful raspy and tinny sound
 That's not what I want in a headset, even for $3
 But I needed an emergency headset and this one fit the bill
 The sound quality is far superior to no-name headsets--on both ends
 It's better than an average Sony/Ericsson handset--I always add a headset to those when using them since Sony deliberately puts crappy speakers into Ericsson phones to make you buy their headsets

 When traveling through NY or DE or any other state that requires no-hands on the phone, it is essential to be quickly disconnect and replace a discharged BT headset
  Highly recommended headset regardless!
Like most people I have owned multiple styles of headsets and had varying degrees of success with them
  The headset unit gives you call answer and end control with your fingertips as well as volume and mute control
  It would operate for up to 8 hours but it has a desktop control stand that charged the headset while I am in a meeting or at lunch
I used the Plantronics HL 10 Handset Lifter and by touching the button on the headset I could answer the phone remotely with ease
  The headset is extremely light and comfortable and the phone transmission is digitally encrypted for security and privacy
I took one start off, because I think that these headsets should be ~100 or less for what we are getting, and this one was the best deal that I could find! The plastic housing on the charger unit could be sturdier f they are going to charge consumers these prices for must haves items like this
 I plugged it into my VoIP phone and away I went! There was something in the description about &#34;USB,&#34; but this unit is hooks up to the phones headset port via a regular old telephone jacks input
I purchased FIVE wireless headsets around the same time for my office workers
  She kept getting a feedback sound in the headset even when not on a call
  I dont know if it was something in the walls making it have feedback, but we couldnt get the problem to stop so she went back to a wired headset
I have been using the headset she had problems with, and i constantly have that annoying pulsing feedback
Problems with 2 out of 5 headsets seems like pretty poor odds to me
I've had this headset for many years (at least 5+, but I can't remember exactly when I got it)

  It's comfortable and fits in your ear, and the sound quality (especially the noise cancellation on the mic) is *stellar* - you can be driving down a noisy freeway and the person listening to you will *never* know you're in the car
I tried several Bluetooth headsets and was thoroughly unimpressed: you have to charge them, they add latency, they add extra compression artifacts, and the audio clips in and out on you
This headset has the disadvantage of having a wire, but it's also about 1/20th the price of a Bluetooth headset, and won't give you cancer
5mm (so you can plug in a headset or just headphones)
  So, once I got a smartphone, I ended up buying half a dozen adapters, because I love this headset so much
I got a pair of Plantronics-branded headsets in Verizon OEM packaging (plastic bag), each coming with a "universal" adapter (micro-USB male to 2

 However, the other photos show the same headset, but without the control button--not a different button, but nothing at all! This made me wonder what is being sold as MX150
But, as far as the product itself goes, it's perfectly functional for the purpose--cheap branded headset (for me, specifically to complement a BT set, which this one replaces when charge runs out)
 I've had a number of cheap or free headsets (often even enclosed with a phone) and virtually all of them have awful raspy and tinny sound
 That's not what I want in a headset, even for $3
 But I needed an emergency headset and this one fit the bill
 The sound quality is far superior to no-name headsets--on both ends
 It's better than an average Sony/Ericsson handset--I always add a headset to those when using them since Sony deliberately puts crappy speakers into Ericsson phones to make you buy their headsets

 When traveling through NY or DE or any other state that requires no-hands on the phone, it is essential to be quickly disconnect and replace a discharged BT headset
  Highly recommended headset regardless!
Like most people I have owned multiple styles of headsets and had varying degrees of success with them
  The headset unit gives you call answer and end control with your fingertips as well as volume and mute control
  It would operate for up to 8 hours but it has a desktop control stand that charged the headset while I am in a meeting or at lunch
I used the Plantronics HL 10 Handset Lifter and by touching the button on the headset I could answer the phone remotely with ease
  The headset is extremely light and comfortable and the phone transmission is digitally encrypted for security and privacy
I took one start off, because I think that these headsets should be ~100 or less for what we are getting, and this one was the best deal that I could find! The plastic housing on the charger unit could be sturdier f they are going to charge consumers these prices for must haves items like this
 I plugged it into my VoIP phone and away I went! There was something in the description about &#34;USB,&#34; but this unit is hooks up to the phones headset port via a regular old telephone jacks input
I purchased FIVE wireless headsets around the same time for my office workers
  She kept getting a feedback sound in the headset even when not on a call
  I dont know if it was something in the walls making it have feedback, but we couldnt get the problem to stop so she went back to a wired headset
I have been using the headset she had problems with, and i constantly have that annoying pulsing feedback
Problems with 2 out of 5 headsets seems like pretty poor odds to me
I've had this headset for many years (at least 5+, but I can't remember exactly when I got it)
  If I don't place the headset in just right, and jiggle it a little to make sure it has a good connection, it doesn't charge
  Not a tremeendous problem except for those rare occassions when I forget to double check when I put it in the charger, and I end up with a dead headset
-There is a very noticeable buzz in the line if you use the phone handset, which means you MUST use the headset
  The simple solution is to just always use the headset, which is fine, but
on those occassions where the headset is dead (see above), you're left with no great option
  When that happens, I end up having to use the speakerphone on my phone until the headset is charged again

  Not a really big deal, but then I get people asking "talk me off speaker phone", and I have to explain to them that I can't
 I like to use a speaker type hands free kit in the car so I don't have to look at the phone to answer, talk or dial
 It rings nice and loud and putting it on vibrate is easy
  The quality of the speakers and microphones on this phone is great

  The speakers can be loud enough to hear in different rooms of the house, or quiet enough you can barely hear them

  I chose the v300 b/c of the extra gadgets (mainly the camera and speakerphone) even thought the rep said samsung users have a hard time getting used to the Motorola OS
  Most of them are pretty standard to cell phones these days, but a few things are worth commenting on:-Great speakerphone
  Very loud and clear sounding, both ways
  It's very loud if you don't already have the phone on silent/vibrate only
  Basically, to quickly change to phone from a loud ring to silent--say in a theater--you have to make a loud noise
  I could've chosen a smaller phone with a better camera, but not with a speakerphone, or with speakerphone, but not at this price
  What I really like (after playing with a friend's) is the loud ringtones, the good reception (despite the lack of GSM coverage in Brooklyn), and the great styling
My favorite phone is still the Sanyo VM-4500 video camera walkie-talkie speakerphone cell phone for Sprint PCS
Works as it is supposed to, lightweight, compact, and very economical
  I replace this unit with my old earphone
  "Now your voice sounds muffled", he said, "and I hear that TV now loud and clear"
  My old earphone almost seems to exaggerate the background noise
I started using this headset two days ago
  My only complaint is that it comes with a case, yet the headset doesn't fit in it without bending the microphone stalk and I'm not comfortable doing that

  Why not give a case that accomodates it and its accessories?UPDATE 4/30/08:  After months of using this headset, I have to say I find it mildly annoying
  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone shopping for a headset
  I really bought it because it was so hard to find a headset compatible with my AT&T; 8525
The sound of this headset is excellent, as advertised
