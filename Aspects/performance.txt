 Though it doesn't exactly meet the fast charging needs of high end phones, it works pretty well on all of them, you just need to be patient
so far no problems, it charges fast that is what i need it
This Charger is awesome! First of all I wasn't expecting it until between 12/12  and 12/17, but it arrived on 12/11,So That was a plus for me! Second, I was kinda skeptical about purchasing it because it says that its for a Galaxy S and Blackberry so that can mean a lot of things! but I figured what the heck its cheap, so what can I loose!  Well, I just got it today and decided to give it a try at work on my Galaxy S4,  it charged  from 80%  to 100%  in about 7 minutes!! Yes i timed it!  and also the cord is long which is a plus for me!  So if your looking for a fast charger with a long cord and not to mention a great price, this is the one!!update:  not sure what the other reviewer meant by saying these are poor quality chargers, because I've had mine for a little over 2 weeks and it's still going strong!!  Love this charger  especially  for the length!!
  it chargers the phone fast and the price is great!  Highly Recommended product!
Good lengthEasy to useVery fast chargingI would recommend it to persons who use their phone a lot

This case helps me run my day smoothly without having to worry about my phone dying
This PowerBear case is a lifesaver!! Charges fast, always reliable
Bought this for my new AT&T; Galaxy SII, the case arrived super fast, its fits the phone perfectly and snug
 I have no issues with any buttons, and the rubber is in a smooth, sort of laminated finish
Like most of the other reviews say, this rubbery case has a smooth exterior, so it doesn't feel like an uncomfortable sticky rubber
Great case fit my samsung galaxy s2 great will order again fast shipping it make my phone look super sexy trust me you need to order 1
arrive on time, good quality, functionally, recomend to protect the samsung galaxy S 2 I9100, fit exactly , recomend to the owners of this smartphone 
I would like a extra cable for my smartphones at work, so I purchased this one
 If I wear the cable around my neck like a bolo tie, people like me better and I can run faster and jump higher
While I haven't tested it's speed against other cables I doubt it outperforms any other OEM cable but it works and that's all I asked for of it
 Doesn't charge super fast but charges it none the less
Purchased this USB cable to connect my Samsung smartphone to my laptop computer
  Note that the cord that came with the phone plugs in smoothly and securely
Item shipped and arrived very fast
Product came really fast, nice long cord, which was great considering factory cord is so short
 So far the phone charges fast and the life is much better than the 2 year old battery it replaced
 The screwdrivers have a decent weight as well and the handles turn smoothy
 great deal and quality product quick and fast Thanks!!
 Also the wear kinda fast if working with tight screws
Very fast delivery
The pliers are just as good as you can get, no problems with them and good finish on the edges, not like razors like othersthe prying tool is just what you need for almost any device you want to tear apart(besides the iPad) they have enough strenght to pry out plastics and even aluminun bodys of smartphones
This tool repair kit is useful for repairs on a laptop, smartphone, eyeglasses, and anything else with very small screws
Yeah, I know, they warned me; but I thought I was smarter than the average bear- not so
 However, the product made a quite audible (at low automobile speeds) click-click-click
 If it is detects any silence for more than a few seconds, it will automatically go into fast forward until it "hears" sound again
 Otherwise, you will find the tape player trying to "fast forward" over any silent portions of your audio feed
 If you believe these make your phone work better then you probably find the stripes down the side of cars make them go faster too
 Moreover, web surfing is much faster than I thought via Bluetooth
 Most smartphones are 3
It's perfect for those of us who don't have smartphones or a headphone jack
5 mm), which is unfortunate, as most smartphones these days are 3
  So, once I got a smartphone, I ended up buying half a dozen adapters, because I love this headset so much
The unit has a fast recharge time in about 3 hours for 100 % full charge from empty
 While using the inverter for AC devices, I also recharged my Android smartphone with the 1A USB charging port
