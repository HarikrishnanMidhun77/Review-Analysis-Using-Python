very good charger, it woks fine, no complaints!!! I would recommend it!! It was good, but not using it anymore!
 It is a genuine Blackberry charger
 One for work and one to keep in the car incase I ever travel and forget my charger
 Though it doesn't exactly meet the fast charging needs of high end phones, it works pretty well on all of them, you just need to be patient
I've had this charger well over a year now, and it still works perfectly
  Most chargers would have broken by now
  The folding blades make this more portable than the chargers that come with some Blackberry models that have adapters for different countries
so far no problems, it charges fast that is what i need it
 it doesn' have an USB as it specified, jus a direct wall charger
I had this charger before and it seem to last pretty good 3 years fits most phones except Iphone and Galaxy 5  but that phone can still use it in the right side of the portal it will Judy charge it a bit slower
 When this charger goes it tends to loose it's fit firmly in usb and has a short
Another very good phone charger that does the job and has a  very affordable price that anyone can afford  to buy it
 For the low price having an extra USB charger this works great
I needed a charger quick and I didn't want to spend $20
00 at the convenience store for a short, crappy charger
 For this price, the charger is great
 It does NOT fall out but if you wiggle it just right it disconnects the charge
If you need a good charger for a cheap price
Bought as a spare charger for the house and turned into my main charger because my other one failed
 Nice long cable and has held up for tons of charges for my Galaxy S3
The charger only lasted a week ad after that it just stopped charging my Samsung Galaxy S3
The charger only lasted a week ad after that it just stopped charging my Samsung Galaxy S3
  They really need to start making these chargers better
This Charger is awesome! First of all I wasn't expecting it until between 12/12  and 12/17, but it arrived on 12/11,So That was a plus for me! Second, I was kinda skeptical about purchasing it because it says that its for a Galaxy S and Blackberry so that can mean a lot of things! but I figured what the heck its cheap, so what can I loose!  Well, I just got it today and decided to give it a try at work on my Galaxy S4,  it charged  from 80%  to 100%  in about 7 minutes!! Yes i timed it!  and also the cord is long which is a plus for me!  So if your looking for a fast charger with a long cord and not to mention a great price, this is the one!!update:  not sure what the other reviewer meant by saying these are poor quality chargers, because I've had mine for a little over 2 weeks and it's still going strong!!  Love this charger  especially  for the length!!
  It charges my SGS4
  I would recommend this charger for the Samsung Galaxy S4
This charger woks wonderfully on the Samsung Galaxy S4
  it chargers the phone fast and the price is great!  Highly Recommended product!
 money spent well!! If you need a great car charger this is the one you need!!
goes into the lighter port a little rough but it charges the phone fine
 it will reach pretty far because of the coiled section but this will put stress on the charge port of your phone which many people dont realize will eventually break it
I purchased two of these chargers for my sister and girlfriend
 They both have Samsung Galaxy phones and needed a car charger so being the OEM fanboy I am, I swooped up on a couple of these for them while remaining slightly skeptical of what was actually going to show up in the mail at this price
I'm happy to report I definitely received 2 OEM Samsung car chargers in the mail in sealed bags with part # barcodes (the kind you'd normally receive in a new/refurb phone)
 It works perfectly and is built as solidly as the $20 Verizon charger
 I highly recommend this car charger and thanks for the great price!
 I wish it has a retractable cord like some other chargers I've used, but other than that, I love it
  The only thing i might have limited was a usb Connect or it charges my t989 without fail
 I also bought at the same time 2 other cheaper charger cords thru amazon that work perfectly
 This is a great car charger, and it does not cost near as much as the junk you get at the local store--not to mention this is the Samsung brand charger verses their junk
Good lengthEasy to useVery fast chargingI would recommend it to persons who use their phone a lot
  I can not get my Samsung S2 phone to charge with this OEM charger
  The lights are on, the phone says its charging but nothing happens
  I am not sure if I got a defective product but it is very upsetting to sit in your car for hours and not see your phone recharge
  If you need a reliable charger, DO NOT purchase this product
If you need a car charger for your Samsung S2, I would recommend the Motorola Vehicle Power Adapter
  It charges fast and is dependable
A very good car charger for your phones, charged my phone pretty quickly and quite affordable, I recommend it to anyone to have as a back up to your charger
The Samsung car charger has stopped working within a 6 month period
  I thought a fuse was blown inside the unit but when I attempted to change it, I've noticed that it doesn't come apart like most vehicle chargers
This charger works great
Though I`m not a expert in cell phone chargers
 Its a charger and it works so I guess buy it
I used this charger for a couple of months now
 Its a very good charger
 It charges my phone very quickly
I needed a car charger and this was very affordable and it worksgreat! The same thing from the store was three times the price
good oem car charger, i originally bought it for my galaxy S2 and later on that week I upgrated to the Galaxy S3 and it works prefectly fine, I would recommend this product
You have to hold it in a certain place in other for it to charge
 I'll just buy the Verizon  charger instead
This charger works perfectly
  It is the official Samsung charger so I was sure it would work just fine
I use this charger with my GS2 from Straight Talk
  This charger is working as expected, charges the phone fine and seems like a quality product, not flimsy and cheap feeling like some chargers I have ordered in the past
  This one does not have the light on unless you are charging
I went thru 3 car charges which they all either stopped working after a few uses or never worked to begin with
This car harder not only works it also charges my phone lightening fast!!! LOVE IT, LOVE IT LOVE IT!!If u are debating u can rest assured this thing is awesome
First, this is kind of cheap-looking, but I did try to buy the cheapest OEM car charger I could for my phone, so that's forgiveable
  The cable is sturdy, but the rubber near the connector is kind of stiff, which makes charging AND operating your phone on the go a bit of a hassle
UPDATE:  Stopped charging after a month
Good charger and is perfect because it is also has a USB connection
 Also love that it is original material it works like that too giving a quick charge when i need it
I have had 3 phone chargers go bad in two weeks
 Most chargers for cell phones are cheaply made
 The cord itself is ok ;however, the plug that looks like OEM and is stamped as such, is crap! Took 8 times longer to charge with this unit! When the cord was paired with the actual OEM plug in, it worked fine
The charger itself working fine up to this point
 It came crushed and is slow to charge my phone
This detachable sansung galaxy s2 travel charger is simply good
First off, the charger works just as it should and all the ports stay connected just fine
In sum: Good charger with good connectivity, looks and acts like it's an original Samsung
it's a charger for dirt cheap and the shipping wasn't more than the item
although i do not use the charger, the cable is useful
This charger doesn't charge the battery of my Samsung Galaxy S2 (i9100) properly
This charger doesn't charge the battery of my Samsung Galaxy S2 (i9100) properly
This charger is exactly like the original one that came with my phone
works good with our phones, better actually than the charger that came with one of the phones initially , great price
  It just like the oringal charger that comes with the Galaxy S 2
I would like to start off by saying that this product is what I ordered and I have no complaints about shipping or the condition of the product when it came to my house, the problem I do have is the micro usb cable that comes with the charger
 Why is it that all of the different companies that sell chargers on Amazon can get the plug part of the charger right but not the micro usb cord? The cord is cheap and not the original cord that comes with the other part of the charger
 I am having the same issue with the charger that I ordered for my galaxy note 2
 Maybe, a 2 21/2 foot cord? And its of a cheaper quality than the part of the charger that the micro usb plugs into
  It charges my phone quickly and the cord is super long
In a nutshell, this is NOT an OEM charger
~~~~~~~~~~August 17, 2013 - UpdateThe seller tried to make amends by sending me three replacement chargers
  It does not charge my phone and in fact, it drains the phone
  It has Samsung markings but it does not charge the phone
After 2 weeks my charger just fell apart while i was taking it from the plug , not a strong charger at all i would have asked for my money but it wasn't even worth it 
  The detachable cable option gives very good flexibility for use with other USB cable chargers
  Good quality for a travel charger
charges me up all the way
 doubles my battery liek promised
much slimmer than I thought and it ads 125% battery
 I am charged for the full day with this case
 Now my phone is charged anywhere anytime thanks to powerbear 
 Acts as phone protector and charging case in one
 Hold charge all day so no complaints
This PowerBear case is a lifesaver!! Charges fast, always reliable
 Protects and keeps me charged
Wow!  What a cute battery case! I saw a Christian sister with one of these on her phone!  That gave ne an idea-I decided to order me and my sister a battery case-mine is white, (since my phone is white), and my sister's is black,(since her phone is blue)
 Doubled my battery life like promised
 Doubled my battery life like promised
Great case, sturdy, doubles battery, wont have to worry any more
 Firefighter work 24 hr shift and never know when if will get to recharge so this is perfect for me and anyone else that can't always plug in to charge each day
couldnt watch movies on the htc without the battery dying
 but battery could be better
 The power indicator is very convenient to know charge pack status
Not Many HTC one battery cases for sale and this one is pretty good for the price
This is absolutely amazing, more than doubles my battery life, so I can forget about carrying my charger all the time
This is absolutely amazing, more than doubles my battery life, so I can forget about carrying my charger all the time

 With the extended battery I am able to enjoy all of the phones features without losing power
Totally worth the money, It protects my phone in even of the most dangerous situations where I dropped my phone and it also keeps my battery going for Days
 He has a charge case for his last phone, and it covered the whole thing
This is a really great case, looks and feels amazing, not to mention that the battery lasts for many hours
I think this case is an excellent choice, since it is not so bulky, the color is nice, the texture on the back is good for gripping, and it extends battery life

 It's a life saver, and there isn't too much on the market at the time for this phone so I am happy with it
 I use this with my Nexus s 4g from sprint and although it does indeed charge my device it causes some major issues, such as screen lag, my computer not being able to recognize what kind of device this is, and causing my phone to constantly jump into car mode
 So if you need a real quick cable for basic charging, this will do it, anything else
 but out of the 3 I bought, 0 have functioned properly with my Palm Pre!  The best I can do is get it to charge, though the entire time it is charging the computer is complaining about "Unknown Device" and "Could not install drivers" even though it works beautifully with the original cable
 but out of the 3 I bought, 0 have functioned properly with my Palm Pre!  The best I can do is get it to charge, though the entire time it is charging the computer is complaining about "Unknown Device" and "Could not install drivers" even though it works beautifully with the original cable
  For that much money, how can you go wrong?  So, I have not used it to transfer data yet, as it it plugged into my PC at work just for charging
  When plugged in, my Palm Pixi prompts me, just as the factory cable does, to transfer or charge
  I have used this cable about 10x to charge now, and it works great!  Do not hesitate to purchase this if you need another cable, or two!
not much to say about a wall charger except it charges my bluetooth perfectly
This charger does the trick
  The charger in my car doesn't work when the ignition is off, and who wants a dangling cord hanging down in their field of vision while driving
Have charged the T505 up once since I got it, and the battery life is reported to be around 18 hours of usage or 30 days of standby

Have charged the T505 up once since I got it, and the battery life is reported to be around 18 hours of usage or 30 days of standby
  I may charge it every couple of weeks
The Motorola T505 doesn't come with an AC charger, only a DC charger
 You can charge in your home at night
I was initially leary about purchasing this item due to the extremely low price and to have free shipping also, but I needed a wall charger since Motorola only includes a car charger with their wireless car phone speakers
  The charger appears to as well made as the other after market chargers I purchased previously for my e-book reader, PDA, camera, etc
  I charged my Motorola speaker without any problems
we bought this charging cord because the t505 only came with a car charger
we bought this charging cord because the t505 only came with a car charger
  this cord offers a convenient way to charge both as we are not in the car for long enough periods for the device to charge completely while travelling
  by bringing in the devices we are able to charge overnight to a full charge
It's true! This cable outperforms the original! When I charge my phone, it's chargier
this was a GREAT buy for me and now I never have to worry about my Incredible running out of battery!
 At first it charged my phone just fine but then it stopped charging; I waited a day to charge again but it still didn't charge
 At first it charged my phone just fine but then it stopped charging; I waited a day to charge again but it still didn't charge
well bought this so i could have a spare cord since i have the original cord in my car with a usb charger there got tired of keeping track where i had it last
I use this cord to charge my phone in my pc at work and it works great
 Doesn't charge super fast but charges it none the less
cable works fine with my verizon Galaxy S4, it charges and transmit the data fine
 A charging and sync cord
 It charges the phone and helps transfer data from the phone to the computer
I have purchased many chargers for my Samsung phone on amazon and honestly the quality is just so so on them
  Maybe I'm just really hard on chargers but I feel like they should last more than a few months
I got this to charge my Samsung Galaxy S2 but it ALWAYS came unplugged from the phone, whenever the phone would be moved it falls out and even just resting on a flat surface it would eventually find its way out of the phone
it works great and came at the right time you can never have enough chargers for every where lol thanks
do you need to charge your phone? so you need to transfer data? then boy oh boy this cable does that
  That's my general-use cord now; this one is relegated to overnight charging where the phone isn't being used
  They require a good charger a d one that is newer and better
damaged charger
 when i recieved it the charger had a short in it
 i had to wiggle the cord for my phone to charge
 It charges my phone pretty quickly and it's great that it retracts
 No problems with this charger
This charger doesn't work very well
 When plugged in, it shows that it is charging, but after ten minutes I'm lucky to get 1% more on my battery
 When plugged in, it shows that it is charging, but after ten minutes I'm lucky to get 1% more on my battery
 I only use it now if my battery is low and I want to keep it from getting lower
I was pretty upset to find that one day it stopped charging my phone, right in the middle of a long trip
I really like this charger and not having the cord hanging around all the time when it's not necessary
 It charges my Galaxy fine, but cord does not retract
 It charges, I suppose that's all that matters
 Though, I don't what's the life for the other charger
 Though, I don't what's the life for the other charger
Initially it is a great charger at a great price
The charger works fine
The plug fits and it charges my Captivate, it felt rather snug
 The "retractable"-ness of this charger is anything but
 Bottom line was that after messing with it and *feeding* it back into the charger versus it retracting itself automatically when depressing the retract button, it took a few minutes to get the plug retracted so that only a few inches of cable was still hanging out of the charger and that was the best I could get
took longer than expected to be delivered but over all satisfied with the charger
This works just fine to recharge my Captivate
  This little charger works well and it was a lot less expensive than Sprint store
  However, I'm not a fan of how long it seems to take to charge to full charge, nor how it atomically &#34;stops&#34; charging at certain times on it's own

This is a very good charger to keep for travel and as a back up in your house
The Phone charger works, it charges the phone
 However, while the phone is charging it continually beeps as when the battery is too low

It will not stop beeping while it is charging until the battery reaches a certain percentage
I do not think this is the correct charger to be using on the phone I have
Now I am worried based on other reviewers that the battery may blow on the phone and I'll have to replace that too
I would not recommend buying this charger
The charger from my old blackberry works better
When i went to take the charger out of my wallit snapped in half
 Sometimes I am using the phone and just one twist or tug of the line and the cable will disconnect from the dc power supply, which I imagine will cause the data cable to short out over time and also may ruin the battery
 i go through chargers pretty quickly so im hoping this one will hold up
32 for the charger and $2
Yeah, I know the shipping & handling was much more expensive than the charger was but I needed a charger that connected and this one fit nice and snug so I am able to charge my phone while sitting at my desk in my home office at my computer looking for work
13 was a great savings compared to how much the retailers that sell the mobile phones charge anywhere from $10-$20
Its a charger and it works as advertised
 Nothing fancy just a charger that does what its ment to do
If your BT is down on battery charge, this is handy

I already had a plug-in in the charger nearest me
I have used this car charger for the last 2 months
 It's not as cool as the wireless headsets (bluetooth etc) but it doesn't take batteries, doesn't have to be recharged and isn't subject to interference
I had to replace the battery on my phone cause it had gone completely flat
 Apple was charging a lot and this battery did the job perfectly for a lot cheaper and came with the tools

 The paper foil was coming off the battery when I open the package but folding back in place worked, once it's in the phone it is not an issue

Update: 4 weeks after installing this battery is would only last 5 hours and that was barely using the iPhone with NO voice calls at all during that time and no extra heavy use of the internet or anything
 Drained it and charged from dead several times, made sure that location services, blue tooth, apps closed
 Got my money back and bought one for 1/2 the price and that one works great! Maybe I just got a defective battery
 The battery, which replaced my 2-year old original one, works well so far after about one and half months
 It gets charged very quickly and lasted very long
 For average user like me, the battery last for about 10 + hours every full charge

bought tool kit to do a battery upgrade on my cell phone
 since it has an embedded battery I needed to take the phone apart
Used this in a phone I repaired, battery fit perfectly and seemed to work fine, phone was on 5 percent, left it for two days, then I checked and it was on 1%, seems legit
Needed for my Razr cellphone to change the internal battery
Seeing is how the 2, 5 star reviews on this item are from fake users who seem to be trash talking other iphone battery sellers and 5 staring there own is pretty messed up so therefore it appears this seller is some type of scammer
After viewing some youtube videos on this procedure, I was able to swap the battery in about 1/2 hour (which included taking pictures and studying the insides of the iPhone 4S
Battery would not charge in iPhone
  I changed the battery in just a few minutes
I received it today and it doesn't charge
I purchased this battery to replace a water soaked one in an iPhone 4
 I don't even know if it is charging or not as the unit won't turn on for me
  She said it seemed to work about the same or a little better than the old battery
  Not a huge improvement, but an acceptable replacement  if you need a new battery
This review is for the iPhone 5 battery and tool set
 slaves) of their iPhones, I came to the end of the usefulness for my iPhone 5's internal battery
The battery I received had a manufacturer date only a few months from when I ordered the piece
 Who knows how accurate that is, but if you're taking it at face value, I find certain comfort knowing that my battery hasn't been sitting on the shelf losing it's potential usefulness in holding a charge for my crushing of candies

After successfully opening my phone, I can confirm that all the labeling and signage match exactly to what is on the original battery in my phone
 Any copycat can do this, but it gives me hope that this new battery comes from the same manufacturers as the OEM battery
 Do some extra research around properly removing the battery
 Use the clear plastic sheet under the battery to help lift it up and separate from the adhesive
 That was the most challenging part of my battery replacement
 After two months of use, I can make it through the whole day after heavy phone use without looking for a charger
 My life is complete again!
i ordered this to replace my iphone battery, i am a deployed soldier and now i have become the cell phone technition
The battery worked very well! I used the screwdriver and the plastic pieces of the kit in replacement, and the tips of the spudger get bent without hard use - such as prying the old battery out
 Still, a great value in a DIY kit to give new life to your tired iPhone 4S!
 The battery itself replaced my old battery perfectly
 It holds a charge well and reads the correct battery percentage

 Now it holds full charge and is ready to go
 but for the life of me i cant figure out how you get them to work short of superglue and even then they are too quiet to hear so i guess they work on the jabra they are designed for but not the jawbone
  I lost the windscreen for the boom mic once and an email to them got me a set of windscreens in my mailbox, no charge
  After pressing more than a few keys, the screen would lock up and I needed to remove the battery to reset it
Last warning:  Watch out for the charges for inbound messages--if you really dislike a T-Mobile subscriber, send them lots of text messages (free from their site)--the subscriber has to pay $0
  I've downloaded Midi files, games and photos off the web and copied them to the T610 for FREE!  No SMS charges or web site fees
  Battery life is still good
I just called T-Mobile with complaints about my weak battery and told them talk time on the cell phone is 840min according to Amazon's specs for the T610 phone
Considering how old the phones that use this type of battery are, I am not surprised that I received a used battery
 The battery I received holds the charge for about a day, which is the same as my old one

 My phone does not have problem with power with this battery and me neither
If I'd bought this battery where I bought the cell phone, it would've cost much, much more
  I didn't need a new phone - just a new battery - so instead of adding another used cell phone to the trash heap, I've recycled a used battery and kept the phone I really like!  The phone now works like new!
I bought this to try and repair a POS dash cam, even though this battery is great it was not the issue
 It fit perfectly and accepted charge as it should
 I've been using this for over a year, seems to hold charge good as OEM (it is OEM)
But I've never gotten good reception with bluetooth units or enough batter life
I tried several Bluetooth headsets and was thoroughly unimpressed: you have to charge them, they add latency, they add extra compression artifacts, and the audio clips in and out on you
But, as far as the product itself goes, it's perfectly functional for the purpose--cheap branded headset (for me, specifically to complement a BT set, which this one replaces when charge runs out)
 When traveling through NY or DE or any other state that requires no-hands on the phone, it is essential to be quickly disconnect and replace a discharged BT headset
  It would operate for up to 8 hours but it has a desktop control stand that charged the headset while I am in a meeting or at lunch
The unit has a fast recharge time in about 3 hours for 100 % full charge from empty
I took one start off, because I think that these headsets should be ~100 or less for what we are getting, and this one was the best deal that I could find! The plastic housing on the charger unit could be sturdier f they are going to charge consumers these prices for must haves items like this
  I am giving it 4 stars for:-simple set up-great sound quality-solid talk and standby time-comfortable, with a variety of wearing options-durability (still serves its purpose after 5+ years)I am taking away 1 star for 2 reasons:-Over the course of several years, the charger has gotten finicky
  If I don't place the headset in just right, and jiggle it a little to make sure it has a good connection, it doesn't charge
  Not a tremeendous problem except for those rare occassions when I forget to double check when I put it in the charger, and I end up with a dead headset
  When that happens, I end up having to use the speakerphone on my phone until the headset is charged again
 Since I bought it to keep some battery backups in for long flights it I don't think it will work for my needs
I have one of these filled with charging cables (both dock and lightning) for iPhones and iPads, car chargers, wall chargers and everything needed to power our mobile devices while traveling
