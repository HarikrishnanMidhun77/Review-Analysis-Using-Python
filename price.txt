Works wonderful for the price
A friend mentioned this phone to me and it worth what he said
Nokia is the brand that can be used in telephone, good price, excellent team, was a gift to my daughter and she liked it, easy to use and very affordable price, I recommend it
 My opinion: it is a worthy update (3g) to the C3, not quite in the same league as the more expensive E5 which has the multi-tasking S60 software

 For the price of around $110, it is an unlocked feature (gsm/3g) phone well worth considering, as long as one knows that one is getting a non-smart phone and that apps for S40 is very limited

 It was WAY more frustration than it was worth
This phone in an excellent phone at a great price
I bought this phone for the advantages to NOT owning a smartphone: longer battery life, higher durability, lower cost, but still good at accomplishing what it needs to
 The price is amazingly cheap
 The price is amazingly cheap
This phone is absolutely fantastic for the price, but some potential buyers may not be fully aware of what to expect when it arrives
Good phone, excellent price
Great phone, excellent price
 Otherwise its excellent and a great price
Absolutely great phone for the very attractive price
 Image quality from camera falls a bit behind Lumia 950, but the price is unbeatable
 However a down side is the app store from microsoft is a little behind the rivals (step up microsoft) overall its a great tool and for the price thumbs up
Excellent Phone fulfilling every minimum requirement as a low cost smart phone
Absolutely great phone for the very attractive price
 Image quality from camera falls a bit behind Lumia 950, but the price is unbeatable
 It also feels and despite the price looks nifty
 Personally the 640 is a better phone for less than a third the price
 Always wanted a 950 but was initially too expensive I purchased a dual sim 950 for 309
Very good phone, and perfect price
tl;dr: this is a good phone for people that like the Windows os, especially at the current price
Great phone, at this price point the look an feel should be more premium, specially in the case
 For the price I got it for (around $320) the competition would have less features
While the 950XL is more powerful, the price increase is not justifiable at this time
Pros:AMOLED ScreenBattery lifeIris scannerIntegration with Windows 10 desktopLight weight for it's sizeReplaceable battery (if you can find one)USB-C charge/data port where it does not matter how you plug it in since it is reversibleCons:feels kind of cheap in the hand

Nice for the price but slow and small
It's nice and I love it for z price but I brought it for Africa so I will c how it work over there ;)
 It's a good phone and well worth looking into
If If you are not at&t costumer and want to use another sim card(international), you just need to remove at&t sim put in yours and enter unlock code, which is written on package of the phone
good phone, especially for the price
It's a good phone and well worth the price
It's a good phone and well worth the price
It's pretty good phone for low this price
Can not beat the price it's worth it
Can not beat the price it's worth it
The price is very good, but if you've ever used an iPhone you won't be satisfied with Windows OS
 Good product for the price
 equivalent to or better than other more expensive phones
and the best part, it's price
Good item, good price
A really great phone for a small price
Half price in Target
I bought it for an expensive price on Amazon
I bought it for an expensive price on Amazon
Excellent phone, well worth the purchase
This is a great phone at a great price
 It's very cheap , fast shipping and a fair size 
Great phone great price unlock
For this price this is an excellent phone
Very good phone for the price, look and feels well built
Absolutely worthless
Great phone for the price
 Similar to my computer, easy to figure out, not expensive
Low cost phone
I had a flip phone, this makes texting easy , good price , too bad Windows Phones are not popular
Good cellphone for the price it's like iPhone 5 performance but better
I'm so happy with this phone, I love windows phone, and this phone comes with the unlock code, (I bought two and the two comes with the code) I'm from costa Rica
Good price, good product,good quality
 My iPhone gets weird sometimes too and was 10x the price
Long battery usage, less expensive but very useful
 Highly recommend, especially at the low price
Excellent phone for the price, I recommend
It's a awesome phone with low price and a great performance
 But is worth it cuz this phone is really fast and the apps from Microsoft and Lumia are wonderful
 Convenient price
 high hardware at low cost+ same configuration screens as our Windows pc's (for a telephone)+ Accept W10 Mobile+ Good recepetion, speed, functionsCons:- With W10 not working sync with icloud anymore- some not common apps no available (i
Perfect for what I want it for the basics yet still it looks and works like one of the more expensive smartphones
For the rest as a power user you can't beat this price
 This phone cost me 56 mil colones ($120) going through taxes and shipping here
Excellent price for excellent product
Great phone for the price
It was a cheap phone, and it does exactly what I would want it to--take pictures, manage my calendar, store my documents, etc
 For the price, I can't beat it
 Sure there are more expensive Android phones with higher specs but why spend the money when you only do what I do everyday
I will not convince anyone to buy the Lumia 640, it is a matter of taste, I value the price, the equipment and the basics I need a phone
, faster than i think for the price, take a few days learn use Windows phone, but is easy; apps run fast
 Now this is meant to be my back up phone but with excellent battery life decent camera and fast performance it has become my main phone atleast until the Lumia 950 is released this is priced below its value you point
an amazing phone for this price
 But The price is 1/8 
Unlocked and the Phone is great for its price, the shipping was a little bit slow, but not seller fault
 To find a reasonably priced phone that did what I needed and did it well was appreciated
5 star PHONE for it's price
 Great price and product as well
Perfecto condition, great price
 Had to get a SIM card for it so add that price above the price of the phone
It's a good phone and well worth the price
It's a good phone and well worth the price
 Where else can you get one of the best smart phones for the price
Nice cellphone, I received it in excellent condition and it has great price
 Nice having a bigger screen without forking out for a Samsung or Iphone (shows my age im so cheap
 This phone cost $299 in NZ for the same single sim model
 Can't beat the price
 Camera quality is not great, but certainly not worse than say the Galaxy Avant or Galaxy SIII Mini, which cost more than this and have far worse and smaller screens

The price is very good, but if you've ever used an iPhone you won't be satisfied with Windows OS
Looks, cost and user friendly appeal is second to none
the return efforts are not worth it
 Third, the initial price was attractive at about $277, but after paying $23 to ship to an FPO AE, the savings of purchasing online didn't really outweigh the peace of mind of purchasing the same phone at a local vendor, where I can walk over and have it serviced or returned immediately if necessary
Nice price for a heavy duty Phablet
This is a wonderful phone for a terrific price
 I give this phone five stars because for the price, who could look for a better deal
I got the phone at said time love the big screen but the charger looks so cheap but I don't no if is unlocked because I bought for someone will buy more stuff from this seller and is very heavy phone

 It's very inexpensive, the battery lasts incredibly long, the voice clarity is great, and it has excellent reception
Pros:Inexpensive
 No worth calling it a cell phone
 Things that could have been better:1) dedicated volume buttons (although this might not be feasible at this price point)2) this phone comes with a flashlight mode that can be activated with the right nav-button combo
 Excellent for using in an international trip when a data roaming costs much money
Pretty cheaply made phone
 And fortunately, the cost is low and it probably will serve our needs to use it only as an emergency type phone
This product was great considering the price
Low price does not excuse low sensitivity with low audio to boot
 Works well, and I'm not afraid if my kid will lose it (it's cheap anyways)
The performance matches its price
Excellent basic and low cost phone
 The price is right and the quality is fine
Nice cheap knock around but doesn't work in most countries which I've found out sadly after leaving the states to where I live in Mozambique
 Not to mention the cost: $25 vs $200 to $600
Inexpensive cell for those not interested in a entertainment device but to actually receive and make phone calls
This cellphone is cheap in price and quality
This cellphone is cheap in price and quality
 They feel cheap and are cheap, but they are surprisingly durable, have great battery life, and just plain work
 Also really nice to keep in my suitcase when I travel internationally because I can pick up a local SIM and walk down the street without worrying about someone grabbing my expensive phone
 This Nokia serves that need perfectly and very inexpensively
 It's absolutely amazing the performance of this little unit for the price
 Well worth the money
Pretty cheaply made phone
 Things that could have been better:1) dedicated volume buttons (although this might not be feasible at this price point)2) this phone comes with a flashlight mode that can be activated with the right nav-button combo
It's okay, price is expensive
It's okay, price is expensive
ok for price
Maybe I am expecting too much from a 20 dollar phone; however, this product is so cheaply made, it could have been sold for less
 I did, the manufacturers used a cheap glue to glue the screen in
 I'm currently using it with Cricket Wireless but might switch to a cheaper carrier (like US Mobile) soon
 And it's cheap enough that I ordered another as a backup
 Very fragile and cheap looking
 It's very inexpensive, the battery lasts incredibly long, the voice clarity is great, and it has excellent reception
Pros:Inexpensive
 No worth calling it a cell phone
 Excellent for using in an international trip when a data roaming costs much money
It's a good value for the price paid
it does everything i want it to do and more and it didn't cost any where near what an iphone 6 would cost
It is made with very cheap material
 Aparently some carriers here are not very friendly with unlocked phones some apps that require internet accses like "Whatsapp" are not supported or barely suported, I had to change the data packet acces point manually to use internet and still I have a lot of limitations and I will probaly have to move to a more stable but expensive carrier like Digitel or Movistar
 That being said, it is probably the best non-smartphone that you can find that will not cost you an automatic data plan charge on your bill
 The map app is just OK (it's no Google Maps), the app selection is pretty lame (the Nokia store doesn't offer much), and the games that are actually worth playing and the phone can handle (it only plays Java games) are few and far between
 Don't even bother trying to play Temple Run on this phone; there's no java version out there worth talking about
 It is not a smartphone but it has a very good browser with excellent wifi access, internet radio etc and it does an excellent job in features that I usually use in my Sony Xperia ion smartphone with a price much less than a classic smartphone
I bought this because AT&T is raising smartphone prices to unfair levels
 It cost a third of what my smartphone was costing me and has most of the features
 Recommend for anyone needing a smartphone like device at a budget price, since it still has web browser, whatsapp, internet radio, angry birds, etc
Refurbished but came like new, excellent phone for the price
 OK for its price and good for elder people who only use the phone for calling 
nice phone for the price
 It doesnt look cheap
However, if you want a relatively cheap high quality unlocked phone to use as a 'phone', I would highly recommend this
you can buy the Nokia X3-02 TOUCH AND TYPE WHITE Unlocked Phone this very nice, the price and the cost
you can buy the Nokia X3-02 TOUCH AND TYPE WHITE Unlocked Phone this very nice, the price and the cost
 price should be below $100
5 stars because at this price ($35) there's no way you're going to get something better
Great, practice and cheap cell phone
 Not a lot to it, but for a phone that is so inexpensive, it doesn't what it's supposed to
Overall a good phone for the price
The phone is working for now but it is so cheaply made I wonder how long it will last
Very good phone for the price
good price, good product
 Can't beat the price
I wanted a cheap a nonsmart phone, and this phone works
 It is very basic, which is why it's cheap, but it is missing some stuff I would have assumed even a basic phone would have
 I'm still giving 4 stars to this phone, since it was so cheap, and does work fine as a phone
 You have to check the rating of your seller, Amazon combines sellers for the same product on this page, so you never know who you are buying from unless you go up to the top of the page and check them out (and keep in mind it'll change often as the cheapest seller changes)
 For what is worth mine was legit
Low signal with this phone, although for the price, I'm happy to say I bought as a back up phone
 It feels like a $50 phone; buttons feels a little cheap--not cheap but a little cheap--like $50 cheap
- Tinny sound (both incoming and outgoing)- No volume toggle (but then, that seems common in these cheaper models)- Feels flimsy- Low-res screenAnd most importantly: NOT compatible with bluetooth earpieces
 I don't return it because transportation is very expensive
if I could return at no cost I would do that, and buy my beloved Nokia C3-01
is a Chinese product of very poor quality, this is a scam, it is not an original Nokia product, the price is not also worth the cover of the battery defective wine, in addition to last long in coming, not recommended at all the reputation of seller, I hope amazon punish him for mocking their customers

 The device is very small and very cheaply made I have been a Nokia admirer and user for years and I cannot believe this is a product of theirs - or Microsoft
 My advice is stay away even at this modest price
work well for the price sent it to a caribbean island

I don't review phones often but if you're looking for a cheap (dare I say disposable) phone that you can use with two SIM cards that is Dual or Quad Band this is your phone
The quality is good, as an used cell phone with a low price, the quality exceeds my expecation
This phone does all I expect of it for the price
 Very basic, but is what I need for a low price
 The signal is good, the volume is great, and the phone looks very good, not cheap made
 If you want a phone that works good for SMS and calls, and do not want to spend more than $50, I think this is the best you can get for the price
Nice phone at this price
Well worth the money, nice little cell phones with no fancy features, just a telephone to have in your pocket
Unless your looking for something extremely cheap, and a little more on the old style, don't get this
 But overall, I think it's a very good unlocked, world phone for the price
 When it comes to mobile phones Nokia always strikes me as being one of the most durable at a reasonable price, hence the reason my attention went straight for the Nokia phone because any mobile phone owned by my husband really needs to stand the test of durability as he doesn't take much care in protecting it
 Great price too
 Good to buy a cheaper one for him
 the camera is ok for the price
 Good quality for the price
Actually I am rating this as 5 due to Amazon reliability, excellent prices, great customer service and schedule adherence
 First off the phone took 2 weeks to arrive and when it finally arrived I found out it was a refurbished phone (which was never mentioned)The box the phone came in was ripped up and contents were cheaply wrapped in plastic that is how I knew it was refurbished
 The camera on it is horrible, I had less expensive phones that had much better picture quality then this phone
 It looks inexpensive (i
 cheap), particularly the keyboard, but everything works just fine, which is more than I can say for the last two phones I bought for my wife that cost a lot more
 cheap), particularly the keyboard, but everything works just fine, which is more than I can say for the last two phones I bought for my wife that cost a lot more
My only complaint is that the microphone suffers from the weird problem that cheap cell phones tend to have - that noises originating from 10-15 feet away from the phone come through much louder than the voice of the person holding the phone
I got this product in a very good price; also I've never had problems with this brand
 I don't need a worthless, lousy, 1
 It covers the basic need for communication in a cool style cheap phone
 I used the older model of their flip phone to death; this new one is much thinner and looks way better than what you'd usually get for the price
 This vendor had one that was inexpensive and arrived very quickly
Simplicity at a great price
 A great basic phone at a fantastic price

Good phones for the price, was a great for the year I got it, I buy those for my parents and they like it
I didn't find the phone expensive either
This is a great low cost cell phone, and it is really easy to use, small and lightweight
 Very cheap with all the options
 Excellent Product for the price spent
 I would suggest getting some inexpensive face plate covers (front and back), since they faceplates not only provide protection to the phone, but also they cut down considerably on the fingerprints
 And while I like some of the features of the Amazon 2720 better than the WalMart 2720, for the price, I'd go with the WalMart 2720 for $31/shipped to the store
 They work like memory card readers, and range in price from around $8 to $30
 I read some reviews and the cheaper ones don't seem to work all that well
](Personally, I find the shipping costs to be ridiculous from both places, but I was unable to find this item from any other source other than Amazon or Dekart directly
The phone is really good for the price with the features it has
) are very reasonably priced compared to some other brands
 This gets the job done fairly inexpensively
 It's a great price for a basic phone
 As for the GPS, the maps are stored offline, so the GPS feature does not require an expensive data plan
 The phone itself looks good, however it feels a little cheap with the plastic housing
This is the third 2760 I've had, and in between I got a Blackberry which wasn't worth the work and the learning curve to have a few more conveniences
 After a lot of hassle, these guys replaced with one Motorola for some extra charges and shipping cost
 A bit pricey for "just a phone" - but some people don't do well with Smartphones, and this is a genuine Nokia, solid as a tank and very familiar interface
easy to use and kind of pretty (for the price)my mom is really happy
) Clarity could be better - the sound IS NOT comparable to a land line phone - but voices are less muffled than on the cheap Go-phones with which we've been making-do
 Compared to smart phones, this phone is pretty cheap at about $85 out-of-pocket, but since I am one frugal mama, that is still expensive to me, especially if it is going to crap out after only a year or two
 Compared to smart phones, this phone is pretty cheap at about $85 out-of-pocket, but since I am one frugal mama, that is still expensive to me, especially if it is going to crap out after only a year or two

I am a creature of habit, but I'm also a cheap SOB
 When the Nokia literally took a nap with the fishes, I looked around for a new phone and ultimately decided I would buy another 301 - until I saw how outrageously they are now priced
) Rather than pay the new extortion price, I hopped over to Kroger and bought a $20 Go Phone
 But when I think about it costing only $20 - I get a whole lot happier
One last Con I discovered since I had to get a new phone: you can port a phone's worth of contacts TO the 301, but woe unto you if you need to port your contacts from the 301 to another phone
 I just ordered some cheap rubber port covers to try to avoid the humidity issues that almost trashed it this summer
 (But it is still horribly overpriced at $200
 volume is very good for inexpensive unit
 I gave it 4 stars because of the high price I paid
but the costs of adding another data plan to the line was just outrageous
Despite the cost of this phone, it was a pretty good buy
 but I'm too cheap to burn my pay-as-you-go minutes for internet
 It feels good in hand (pretty heavy, not cheap, even though is a cheap plastic)
 Great phone at twice the price
This is a GREAT phone for the many, many of us that want a PHONE, not an overpriced piece of techno glitter with a bazillion features we neither want nor use
With the ability to quickly swap out the SIM from my Berry to this 301, I've got a fun and useful duo for the same price as compared to upgrading to popular 32 GB models of other smartphones, while using the latest iterations of some longtime players in this still, relatively new field

If you are looking for a reliable phone that makes great quality calls, has good battery life and is reasonably-priced then this is the phone for you
 Amazon has all the OEM accessories at great prices as well
First - I am shocked at the $30 rise in price in just two weeks for this well-made phone from Nokia
 The seller accepted it back and refunded the purchase price within days
 This is an excellent phone 4 the price
 This is an excellent phone 4 the price
Has some scratches and wear and tear phones works fine but i got charger, sim cards and case box and manuals so not bad for the price
 Was a good stop stop gap phone for me in between phones for the price as well
 not worth a doller it got broken on the first day i got it
 not worth it 
I bought this phone here because at the time it was $30 cheaper than what T-Mobile wanted non-contract
 Thankfully Amazon allowed me to return this phone and T-Mobile was willing to cut their price some since I had to buy it from them and wasn't happy about it
Regarding the phone itself, it's a decent inexpensive smart phone
 The screen is small compared to more expensive phones
 It's unlocked and doesn't cost an arm and a leg like many other unlocked phones do
 I would not recommend the phone if it were more expensive(I paid $149)
 I tested it in all posibles ways and I am impressed with all funcionsI just love have free ovi maps for my gps and I dont have to buy it anymorethe only little thing is that no wifi included for this model but for his price was just a bargainand the best part is it works in every country with GSM network (In other words, ALL)You only can say enjoy it
Reputation of Nkia where does it stand, manufacturing such an outdated model with a price of $ 149
I travel a lot and this is what I needed at a very reasonable price
 You can't expect more for such a price
 It is no iPhone, but given it doesn't require an expensive data plan and its price, it is certainly perfectly fine
 It is no iPhone, but given it doesn't require an expensive data plan and its price, it is certainly perfectly fine
This is a good and durable cell phone, though I bought this 2 years ago at $75, so I guess is a little overpriced right now, compared to all new options available on the market these days
Not worth the money
 Instead buy some more expensive but reliable one
 Very happy with the purchase and the price is amazing
 for everyone else: (i agree with one previous reviewer) why not get an iphone or android based phone for the same price
it works great in costa rica
 overall, it was a smart and cheap purchase
Bottom line, with this kind of price ($165)
 It doesn't look as cool as the newer DROID or iPhone GUI, however look at the price compared to them, and you don't have to sell your soul to AT&T or T-Mo

 When the phone arrived I notice there's dust inside the screen, so I suspect it's a rejected one, but the seller sold it to me as a 'brand new' one, I paid for it at a 'brand new price'
 (hint get prepaid sims available in most major cities) And this option is a lot cheaper than having to pay international roaming charges
 I think this is one of the cheaper phones which has touch screen capabilities without having a contract (of 2 years usually) and no data plan required
 But hey, N97 is coming, for a difference of price too
 It is well worth the cost and does everything I wanted it to do

 All I have now is very expensive MP3 player
 Careful for the same price one can buy the C6 which is much better
 I discovered it one day after I bought but the return fees from the seller would make it 50 U$ more expensive, so I decided to keep it
after almost 3 months, no complaints so far and can't beat the price
i have had this phone for about 4 months and is great u have everything u need on it, u also can download vey useful aplications so is like a little pc, very good price for than amazing phone
Is one of the cheapest middle-high-range touchscreen smartphones
 Doing anything other than making calls is simply not worth the trouble on this phone
 for a phone worth 275 almost 15 months ago
 What I need is a smart phone with a real GPS, instead of A-GPS that requires a data plan (most of US data plans become horribly expensive in Europe)
Once the navigation also works (without data plan and go online), I really think this phone is EXCELLENT, especially compare its prices/functions with iPhone
 but nowhere near the low price of this phone
 Plus, I wanted this all at a reasonable price since I would not be getting any plan subsidy
 The 5800 does but my wife's E75, a phone released the same year and is much more expensive than the 5800, does not
 If you spend time overseas, you will probably be buying local pre-paid sim cards (the 5800's quad-band GSM capability lets you do that everywhere) with no or expensive data service
 All this for a reasonable price without a contract
 This item came up at the top of the list at the price range I was looking for
 Total cost was $[
This cel phone is very good with a very good price
 Until a few weeks ago I thought it was a decent phone, a cost effective alternative to a 2-year iphone contract and iphone data
Excellent, I have not had any problems and the cost is very good, I recommend it
I am sorry, but I do not buy a "cheap" $340 phone, just to figure out how to make a phone call, or take a note, or make an appointment, or take a picture
 Great Amazon price, quick shipment, way more positive add ons than the overpriced Iphone
The Nokia5800 XPress is really an outdated smartphone for a high price
Excellent device for a good price
It does not worth the high price
It does not worth the high price
 My son loves it and I feel that it was worth my money
 Just not the smart phone price
Feels cheap as a whole this phone is cheap do not waste your money
 Made of plastic and extremely cheap I cannot say cheap enough
 But because Nokia markets this as an XpressMusic phone, you can use it with AT&T's cheap medianet data plans, or just use WiFi without any data plan at all if you prefer (I've got unlimited data for $10/month on the family plan)
You simply cannot beat this phone's combination of features, performance and price
i buy this phone bcos i want to use it as phone and i-pod like i-phone, i use t-mobile service which is far cheap than at&t's i-phone service
1 cheap plastic body of phone
For the price I got this on sale for versus how much cell phones cost locally, I have no buyers remorse
For the price I got this on sale for versus how much cell phones cost locally, I have no buyers remorse
 but is too expensive
 But the 5800XM have similars features but you pay half price
 La configuración es un poco dificultosa ya que por defecto se conecta por la red de telefonia celular y en Argentina eso es todavia muy costoso
En cuanto a la calidad del equipo y del costo y de sus prestaciones es muy bueno
 I wanted a reasonably priced smartphone that allowed access to the web, made phone calls, had gps, a decent camera, etc etc that was NOT an IPhone
 I just wanted a practical high-tech phone at a good price (with no contract) and this seemed to be it
 And just to prove that it is this phone, I took out the sim, put it into a cheap GSM phone I own, and I have great call quality, no dropped calls, and it works like a charm
 Now I find out that the price droppes by 20 dollars to 240$
Really good value on this purchase, this phone does a lot for a little price tag
plus:for the price has good featuresworks mostly finegood receptioncons:slow response timeno "alphabet" on dial pad view (hard to call for ex
 you cant go wrong for the price of a touchscreen 3g phone
 After reading all the reviews about this phone and seeing the price of an Iphone (well out of budget), I decided on this nokia
 For the price I think this phone has great value, it was one of the cheapest I could find with wifi, great for music and movies (forget games and apps)
 For the price I think this phone has great value, it was one of the cheapest I could find with wifi, great for music and movies (forget games and apps)
 It has most of the stuff you would get in an iPhone for 1/5 the price
 Anyway, ill give an update later about how this all turns out but i really do think the phone is worth the money it may have some annoying aspects about it but you wont find a phone with all these features for that kind of price so if you want a nice phone and dont have a very large budget i would suggest this phone

 i selected 5800 because it has the biggest screen and is the cheapest
The Ovi store is still not worth going to
Overall I would say its a nice phone for the price but there are just too many phones out this summer to settle on this one
1 word of caution if you buy it from Amazon and try there Unbox offer for $50 worth free video downloads, I entered the promo activation code and was still charged for the video
for the price you get a lot of features that are competitive with some of the more popular phones
This is a great mobile, it's a good cost-benefit relation
 I did not find it to be worth the monthly fee
 It isn't as high tech as an iphone, but its close to it with a cheaper price(without having to get a contract)

 one more thing I actually got a cover for the phone and I bought a reasonably priced 16 g microsd card because my 8 gb that the phone came with has 1
Although it is not perfect, i'll give it five stars since it's one of the most complete cellphones in the market, specially considering the price
 I am happy with my purchase don't believe I over spent and may actually save in the long run by it being unlocked (I didn't have to purchase a more expensive plan, like with I phone)
 In spite what other people say about cheap looking, made in China and all that - I totally disagree
 I recommend waiting for a good price on amazon this phone price keeps going up and down during different days
 Bur remember you get what you pay for, 5 stars is for the fact I paid such a low price and it is what it is
 If it was a little more expensive, I would have given it 4 or 3 stars
I have been eyeing this phone for months watching for a price break, which finally happened last week
 The SE Satio has been released, but not in the USA and it is pricey
 If you are looking for a reasonably priced phone with lots of features, you should definitely consider the Nokia 5800
I currently live in Nicaragua and I had seen this phone on the market however it was extremely expensive ($480 aproximately) however for some reason I looked it up on amazon and it was a great surprise when I saw it was nearly $200 less here So I decided to buy it and I must admit I was a little scared to do so but I was greatly surprised when I finally got it in my hands, I had it sent over however the person who received it over there loved it as well and was surprised when he got it before the expected date
 Bundled with the package is a certificate which allows you to download $50 worth of movies from Amazon
 I got six movies (both hi-def and mobile versions) for this price and they all fit on the 8 Gigs of hot-swappable storage that comes with the phone
 In short I chose this phone and adore it now due to its form-factor (not too big, not too small), its screen, its expandability and flexibility, its hardware features (GPS, Wifi, audio) and most of all, its competitive price/quality ratio
Moving on, the cellphone is good for the price
 I think it is a pretty good phone for the price
 I was going to wait until the N97 was released but the $600 or $700 price tag was too much to take
 I ended up buying the 5800 from Amazon at a reasonable $302 which was the same cost as the 16gb Iphone minus the 2 year contract
 There are a good amount of free apps but the ones that cost money seem to range anywhere from $2
 With the $50 rebate, that puts the price to below $300 which is just amazing compared to what the IPhone would cost coupled with PDA monthly data charges

unfortunately everything that it came with before as standard accessories were missing or in more appropriate words reduced (hence the price cut perhaps
I thought it was a reasonable price for a Nokia touch screen phone with WiFi, 3G, GPS, etc
 and costs lot less than Iphone too, so I ordered it
 (you will have a hard time with 1-800-CAL-WHAT)iPhone killer: (differences with the iphone)Better CameraBetter Music playersturdierBetter upgrading optionsLower costBetter browserMature OS (with Flash)Support for A2DP bluettoth (clear sound in bluetooth headphones)Better screen ResolutionMore touchscreen inputs (like stylus and handwriting)2 cameras and support for video calls
This is the worst phone I've ever come across, even worse than my other cheap $20 Nokia
- The alarm feature is worthless
 $50 or less is a more realistic price, provided you are willing to deal with all its shortcomings and software bugs
 Just think about Verizon and AT&T announcing raising prices on data plans for heavy data users
 For the price I think this is a very good smartphone if your lucky enough to get a good one
Excelent phone for this price I think the best touch screen phone for less than $400 u can found, works perfect in Costa Rican services
 I had a cheap nokia a long time ago and I always found that it had the best reception and best battery life of all my phones
Bottom line: If you want a great phone for the price this is it
I had owned various phones in the past and Nokia is the best on any comparison, for the Features available on this phone, had Apple had all these features it will cost 10 times more, most people don't even know it has extra camera on the front for video Calls along with the 3
 Best feature, no MP3 conversion required, if you have lot of MP3 files on hard disk just drag and drop in few seconds, we can play, phone comes with 8GB of SD Card, can upgrade to 16 GB, that's more than enough, I had used the N95 earlier which costs double this price, this is not a NSeries phone from nokia, but it had all the features + touch screen of N series phone at half the price

 I signed up for the free trial and it was useful, but my Garmin does a better job, but the Garmin was more expensive than this phone and that is its primary function
Well the nokia 5800 is a really nice phone, great price at amazon as always, a bit on the chubby side, but is very easy to use
 Great feautures for the price
 It's a decent phone for its price
 You will be able to squeeze a lot of use out of this phone on the cheap and enjoy doing it
 I think it is a better phone for the money, cheaper phone but better quality and responsivness
over all, I think this phone worth of the price, it still a nice phone since no phone is perfect
over all, I think this phone worth of the price, it still a nice phone since no phone is perfect
My daughter wanted an iPhone but even she agreed it was overpriced
 I gave it 5 stars because of the cost to quality and feature ratio
 Very cheaply made
This product is nicely equipped with more than enough features, but for my sole opinion the price should be a little more lower to beat all other competitive
 Well worth every single penny
 Excellent feature set in the price range (sub $250) - Bang for the buck3
 All in all iphone is far superior hardware (and so it thrice as expensive unlocked) but your Nokia 5800 XM won't let you down
This is a really good phone for all of those people looking for a cheaper option for a good touchscreen smartphone
 (hint get prepaid sims available in most major cities) And this option is a lot cheaper than having to pay international roaming charges
 I think this is one of the cheaper phones which has touch screen capabilities without having a contract (of 2 years usually) and no data plan required
 But hey, N97 is coming, for a difference of price too
 It is well worth the cost and does everything I wanted it to do

 great product for a great price
I bought this phone mainly because I couldn't afford the high cost of AT&T's iPhone monthly packages
I was looking for a smart phone without a contract that doesnt cost an arm or a leg
For the price that i pay
Very good cell phone for the price
This phone costs same as iphone4 or any android phone(with contract), but with iphone4 you have to pay atleast $60 every month and there will be some hidden costs as well
The Nokia5800 XPress is really an outdated smartphone for a high price
Excellent device for a good price
It does not worth the high price
It does not worth the high price
 The phone is a touch phone that comes with a little stylus, which is lost easily but very cheap and easy to replace if you buy spares on eBay
The Bad-The phone is a fingerprint magnet and you will be constantly wiping-The screen is sort of plasticity feeling and not as nice as other touch screens-The phone is too thick, and if you get a cover(which you do need) it gets even thicker-The stylus is annoying and is easily lost-The graphics mess-up and freeze all the time, sometimes distort and you have to lock and unlock, or even reset in extreme cases, to fix them-Every couple of months the phone will get stuck and vibrate uncontrollably, you'll need to reset it to fix-It can sometimes get confused with orientation and won't known whether to be vertical or horizontal when you text-The setting take a little while to figure outThe Good-The phone is the nicest touch phone you'll find at such a low price-The customer service is helpful-It is very resilient for a touch phone and has withstood many falls and bangs (in part thanks to the case)-It seems like it will last you a couple years-It's a nice phone for someone on a budget who wants to get something a little nicer than a basic phone-You can browse the internet-You can download some apps and different features-I have never seen anyone else with the same phone at least here in Florida, and it seems to be a little more uncommon in the US, so you'll probably be the only person you know that owns one (which can be a good or a bad thing I guess)In conclusionIf you want a nice not too expensive touch phone, with some web capability get this phone, but if you're looking for and iphone or Android substitute look elsewhere

 Overall a decent phone that's a bit pricey and can be frustrating to use
 It was basically a Samsung P3 with better sound and video while being a phone at the same time - all for the same price - with free movies, gift card, and accessories thrown in
 Doing anything other than making calls is simply not worth the trouble on this phone
 for a phone worth 275 almost 15 months ago
 All I have now is very expensive MP3 player
 Careful for the same price one can buy the C6 which is much better
 I discovered it one day after I bought but the return fees from the seller would make it 50 U$ more expensive, so I decided to keep it
after almost 3 months, no complaints so far and can't beat the price
i have had this phone for about 4 months and is great u have everything u need on it, u also can download vey useful aplications so is like a little pc, very good price for than amazing phone
Is one of the cheapest middle-high-range touchscreen smartphones
 My son loves it and I feel that it was worth my money
 Just not the smart phone price
Feels cheap as a whole this phone is cheap do not waste your money
 Made of plastic and extremely cheap I cannot say cheap enough
Excellent, I have not had any problems and the cost is very good, I recommend it
 Otherwise, the phone was very good -- lots of stuff for the price and the GPS works when you aren't in a service area
 The average iPhone, for example, can cost over 3 thousand bucks over 2 years
 I can't stand locked-down, over priced products that fail to really create compelling value for users that pay for the total package
 This is usually an extra-cost item you have to pay for
OVI Suite makes life a little easier - backups, edits, map downloads, syncing, seamless so farEssentially UNDER priced given its capabilities (compare this phone to a 4-600 dollar newer phone)Feels like a true open-source, unlocked phone (unlike Google's ad machines and Apples prison-camp approach to technology)decent camera with functional macro lensCons:UI is not an A+ - more like a solid B
OVI not as well integrated as iTunes (but I hate iTunes anyway)Not sure what documents this thing can handle (pdfs will cost you)Your girlfriend will HATE the amount of time you invest getting set up, updated, downloaded, etc
All in all, when I got the GPS working the way I wanted, I fell in love with this little phone - it is a true powerhouse for the price, and if it lasts, I expect it will be remembered as my first great smartphone
In the mean-time, I'll be greatly enjoying a solid all-around experience with a ton of value added for a minimal cost
 This is a very good phone has most of the features that you would find in a more expensive phone
 The only issue i found is that a little thick but the price is very reasonablle
 Yes, I would and knowing what has been presented here, and in other reviews for the price, I would recommend the phone to others who are considering it vs
I am sorry, but I do not buy a "cheap" $340 phone, just to figure out how to make a phone call, or take a note, or make an appointment, or take a picture
 Great Amazon price, quick shipment, way more positive add ons than the overpriced Iphone
 but nowhere near the low price of this phone

simple, classic telephone for an extremely low price
 Ordered this one as an inexpensive replacement, as we used to have a similar one years ago
 and the price is so good for the features
Good @ the price
 One great difference is that the Nokia 603 cost me only a fraction of the price I paid and would have to pay for a new Nokia 808
 One great difference is that the Nokia 603 cost me only a fraction of the price I paid and would have to pay for a new Nokia 808
Good phone in a very good price
 Is not the fastest, or the greatest, but, for that price I thing it's quite good
 and the price is so good for the features
Good @ the price
 This is what we found at a decent price and new at that
Good product at this price however it's outdated presently with so many new phones in market
 THEREFORE, I presume I have been sold a used phone with a worthless, self-printed manual and a Chinese non-OEM battery
 This is her favorite phone and I was so glad to find it on here and for such a great price
 It is made of plastic (and feels a bit flimsy), but for the price, it is a great phone
 If you don't want a smart phone this is a good choice, and many are available at a good price
This is an excellent product at an great price
 But, hey, none of the high-priced and over-sized iPhones are perfect either
Good phone for the price
 I dont like when someone cheats in this cheap way
 Great price
 (A new phone was cheaper than a new battery
GREAT to be able to buy a low cost phone without a 2 year obligation
I bought this phone for my mother - when I got it to her it never worked - turns out it was burnt out to start and the cost of fixing it was more than the cost of the phone to begin with
for just your basic phone, you can't get better for the price
 This phone fills that role and meets my cost guidelines
 I wanted to change her to a less expensive plan which is why I bought this phone
Good functional phone at a great price for anyone who does not want or need a smart phone AND no 2 yr contract
This phone has all features that I need; it fits in my pocket with its small size - works great and so was the price
 It has all the features he wanted and it was a good price
 Other than that, a nice, little cellphone for the price
 The $90 pricetag was a bit steep for just a basic phone but I wanted a proven product, just like my old one, in red
 Obviously, this is an issue with his hearing impairment, but it might be worth keeping in mind that even though the volume of the ringer can get loud, the ringtone may not be in a good frequency
 It's more expensive than I would like it to be, but it has lasted about 10 months so far so that's alright I suppose
 we are living in costa rica so i needed something unlocked
 My old 6350 was worn out after 2 years of use (and abuse), so this new 6350 is a perfect and low cost replacement that works great
Great phone very easy to use simple I love it works well price is great to 
 Red isn't my favorite color, but I settled for it because of the price
 To expensive
This was a cheap phone and I guess you get what you pay for
