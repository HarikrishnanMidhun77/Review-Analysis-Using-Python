Bought this as an alternative to a smart phone and data plan
 The smart phone type features are easier and faster to use than any smart phone I have used
 The smart phone type features are easier and faster to use than any smart phone I have used
 Although the new Nokia browser is pretty Spartan in appearance, it is fast and runs with good stability
 I am a very big guy with lands large even for my size and I find the full qwerty keyboard to be pretty easy to use
 I like the programmable hot keys and on-screen shortcuts
 All in all I would recommend this phone and vendor highly if you want the features of a smart phone but you don't need GPS or a big data bill every month for a bunch of things you don't need or want to keep you life running smoothly

 It was very easy to use
 Having been used to smart phones w/ touch screen, I surprised myself when I worked w/ it easily not having read the instructions to operate it
perfect, practical, easy to handle, good resolution, well packed
Nokia is the brand that can be used in telephone, good price, excellent team, was a gift to my daughter and she liked it, easy to use and very affordable price, I recommend it
 Nokia Xpress is a bit sucky but I downloaded an Opera browser for the phone and it works slightly better so internet experience is pretty easy
 For the price of around $110, it is an unlocked feature (gsm/3g) phone well worth considering, as long as one knows that one is getting a non-smart phone and that apps for S40 is very limited
The keys are a little hard to hit, and I didn't expect a Spanish keyboard
Preface: This is not what would be considered a smartphone in the United States (Nothing on the par of Android, iPhone, or Windows Phone), it is basically a feature phone
 The style of the hardware is attractive and the Gray is a nice color
 That immediately eliminates this phone as a smart phone
I bought this phone as a Christmas present for myself because I wanted something a bit more advanced than the Nokia C2 I purchased from Amazon in 2012, but didn't want to go all the way with a smartphone
 In other words, a good feature phone with smartphone features without the touch screen
 Basically everything I was able to do with my smartphone, without the bells and whistles
 This is the best phone you can get if you're looking for functionality, but don't want to throw hundreds of dollars at a smartphone with a data plan
And the buyer should be aware; this is NOT a smartphone
 If you're looking for anything like a smartphone, you will be disappointed
I bought this phone for the advantages to NOT owning a smartphone: longer battery life, higher durability, lower cost, but still good at accomplishing what it needs to
 it works fine, its easy to use, not too heavy
 WhatsApp, Internet , app, radio, keyboard qwerty easy for use
 This Asha 302 phone is just that - all of the Symbian S40 simple goodness, with a much higher quality set of hardware
 The screen is sharper, processor faster, phone takes nice clear pictures that are pretty much good enough, the ring and alert tones are more discreet and professional
Es un celular de gama baja que hace su trabajo dando además algunas características propias de los smartphones
It's a low-end cell does its job well giving some characteristics of smartphones
 I had to do a hard reset on this phone THREE TIMES within the span of two weeks
 In my order, there was hardly any sign that it was handled at all, except for maybe a little finger print on the front glass
com has a fairly easy to read article explaining the differences between the two
 The screen also seems to attract a large number of fingerprints as well, and for some reason is not all that easy to clean off
 For me it works best outdoors, as indoor shots tend to have more noise for whatever reason
 The hardware is just unable to fully handle the new OS
 Unlike most smartphone map applications, it does not require data in order to run
 The simplicity of this phone makes it easy to learn and pick up for anyone
 The live tiles are easy to use and multi-task through
 And this phone is blazing fast
very easy to use, all the basic things i needed on a simple but trendy touchscreen phone is in this one
 One of the best smartphone right now
 Delivery was fast
 Is fast and multitasking
 Phone is very light, back cover opens nicely and easy
 Double SIM support, fast and responsive, very nice looking and unbelivable light
 Has very good battery life and the os works extremely smooth after a week of playing with it
 Finally I value the service received by the vendor who sent it fast and everything was fine
A really nice phone, battery life is good for a smart phone, the screen resolution is very good the its light weight, the memory is also expandable with an sd micro card 4g network makes browsing excellent
 It is fast enough, but not as smooth as 950

Excellent Phone fulfilling every minimum requirement as a low cost smart phone

Item isn't as described and seller is not an easy person to negotiate
 Double SIM support, fast and responsive, very nice looking and unbelivable light
 So easy to rearrange and resize tiles
 Sometimes miss amazing moments of photos of my kids because the phone freezes after taking a single picture
 Looks and works as good as any smartphone on the market with Windows 10 near seamless integration across all Windows 10 OS devices and Microsoft cloud
 I use Office 365 on my 4 computers and 3 smartphones
 It doesn't crash as much as android and yet allows for more customization and freedom to do with your device what you want
 It's pretty fast and fluid as well, and despite all you hear about the app gap I have pretty much everything I need on the phone
When I got it, though, it would kill the battery in half a day and get really hot
 You need a really fast card
 That fixed the heat and battery drain, though it definitely isn't as good on battery as the 1520 was
 I also have issues logging into wifi hotspots, where a login page is needed
This is one of the zippiest and smoothest working Windows phones
 Windows 10 is fast, friendly and intuitive
Nice device and it was delivered really fast and without a scratch
 The hardware makes the OS experience butter smooth and there is absolutely NO lag
 The hardware makes the OS experience butter smooth and there is absolutely NO lag
 text is crisp and easy to read
The most important for me is that it let me work smoothly in my Windows ecosystem: laptop, tablet phone, xbox
Good hardware, not so flashy but a decent case fixes that anyway

 I might be missing something but it appears that this phone doesn't support LTE speeds
 What I can say definitively is that when you get to the data speed connection settings that highest it goes to is 4G
 Looking at another site I did notice that the a 640 LTE unlocked version If data speed is vital investigate with your carrier
 Phone is fast and responsive
A wonderful phone, easy to use with Windows and all the programs I need from Windows office
If you want to use it as a second phone or hotspot you're good to go
 Easy to use, practical and so fast
 All the hardware shown in the description make the phone run smoothly in every action you make with it, the camera is fantastic and since the store doesn't have some of the official apps the community adds there own and work just fine

 It's very cheap , fast shipping and a fair size 
The delivery was fast
My husband and kids gave the phone for mothers day as a gift I love the camera and how fast it is
 At first, with the 4S, I could access my photos from my windows computer, but then that feature went away during some "update
Purchased from seller Aimportar and delivery was super fast
 Also shipped fast
As a first time smart phone user, this phone is perfect for me
 Similar to my computer, easy to figure out, not expensive
It is a phone very fast, it's OS is easy to use single for every one
It is a phone very fast, it's OS is easy to use single for every one
 It start with photo gallery not responding and then follow by everything disappear from the screen
 Soft reset hard reset did not fix anything
I had a flip phone, this makes texting easy , good price , too bad Windows Phones are not popular
This is my first smartphone and i'm very happy with it
 Works smooth no lagging so far
 Even so it's a great format, super fast and super easy to learn and use
 Even so it's a great format, super fast and super easy to learn and use
 Is exactly as seller described fast shipping had no problems with it did not need to contact seller
 But is worth it cuz this phone is really fast and the apps from Microsoft and Lumia are wonderful
 I used as my 2nd telephoneSummary:Pros:+ nice 4" screen same iphone 6+ good response speed in functions+ Most of the needed apps available (watsap, skype, tunein, twitter, etc, )+ with w8
 high hardware at low cost+ same configuration screens as our Windows pc's (for a telephone)+ Accept W10 Mobile+ Good recepetion, speed, functionsCons:- With W10 not working sync with icloud anymore- some not common apps no available (i

Works great, good value if you aint tryna drop tons of money to get a smartphone
A very good phone that is even easy to use
Perfect for what I want it for the basics yet still it looks and works like one of the more expensive smartphones
 I would recommend it to anyone looking for a value-for-money smartphone
 It has basic apps you would need from a smart phone (No you cant play clash of clans, No it does not have 1 kazillion apps like android does), but I dont use a lot of apps either
 It is a great deal for someone who wants to have a decent smartphone
What I really love is that, with this same hardware, an Android phone is lagging so bad and Windows Mobile (beta) and Windows Phone 8
I am not an expert smart phone user
 This is my second smart phone ever
 I thought the Microsoft device would be relatively user friendly, and easy to operate
 Now that Microsoft has decided to shut down the Nokia smart phone division and cut down thousands of employees, the future support looks uncertain
 Now I am thinking of donating this phone to someone who does not use Google account on smart phone
 It's simple, fast, and intuitive
 The Windows OS gets a lot of heat but compared to Android, it is much more fluid and fast

I like my phone but some apps wont work the same like facebook and messenger you cannot watch live im a teenager so that's important but other than some apps camera works fine fast phone nice screen size beautiful hd viewing
, faster than i think for the price, take a few days learn use Windows phone, but is easy; apps run fast
, faster than i think for the price, take a few days learn use Windows phone, but is easy; apps run fast
 Now this is meant to be my back up phone but with excellent battery life decent camera and fast performance it has become my main phone atleast until the Lumia 950 is released this is priced below its value you point
 You can buy the AT&T GO Phone for $55 and get the unlock code from AT&T for free (a simple google search will give you easy to follow instructions)
 it was the fastest
 Screen is bright and easy to read, sound quality is good and the performance is fast enough for the apps I use
 Screen is bright and easy to read, sound quality is good and the performance is fast enough for the apps I use
 SOFTWARE sells Hardware, and unfortunately this bargain of hardware its throw to waste
Phone functioned well enough but original language was Italian and was hard to get it changed and it would not mesh well with my local network
Plus the screen cracked very easy after the phone was dropped from 3 feet
 The front and back camera are good, especially when combined with Lumia Selfie and Lumia Camera, allowing you to control a lot of elements in the photo
The OS' store is it's only "downside"If you want the most customization and apps and are familiar with using smartphones get an android, as many techies prefer
my 1st smart phone
 It's easyenough to mess-up and have to start over
 It was so easy to set up, AT&T was very helpful with navigating me through everything
 The OS is reliable, stable, very easy to use, and the battery life is pretty decent
 Also, the unlock code was really easy to find
 A lot of apps that crash or that don't work correctly
 Where else can you get one of the best smart phones for the price
Great no complaints, nice and smooth workig phone, box was opend, this was done so they can unlock the phone for you, seller explained this in discription
 Make sure you get the screen protector for it too though as is easy to scratch the big screen if your a male
I love this phone, its not that fast although its speed did not seem to decrease when several apps were opened but it has a good camera and takes decent photos in low light and good quality video with sufficient ambient light present

 It also runs very smoothly
 Battery life is beyond excellent, and the phone runs very smooth on the most updated Windows 10 software (build 10
 I'm not what I call a picture taker by I find myself taking way more pictures than my last two smartphones
The phone is great, brought to Brazil, the best camera I had, and overall system is way faster then my old 640xl
Ok, the good: 1) It's compact and I love slider phones that cover up the keyboardAnd the bad: 1) It was a pain in the butt to figure out the configurations to get the mms to work, but that's part of getting an unlocked phone2) Every time I use the text to send to an email, the phone turns off and restarts3) The keyboard buttons are pretty flat & are close together so it's easy to hit the wrong button4) The camera quality is crap, but you can't really expect much from a phone like this5) The alarm feature worked like once
 It's good feature compare to big screen smartphone that leak on charge
but in regards to the latter statement, I believe you can download any type of camera u want and use the downloaded camera for photos instead of the default camera
 It has decent processing power, a nice big screen, and a great battery life for a smartphone (3 days
 Fortunately, 2G is pretty easy to get
 But don't expect great internet speed on this in the US
 It also gets extremely hot when in use
 When updating, it has to be hard reset because it freezes and goes dead
 Great specs and very easy to learn
 Very fast
 Though it was in Hong Kong English, it was easy enough to reset the phone without losing the app bundle it came with
 Though if you want to save maps directly to the onboard mem, memory be eaten up fast
 Second, the phone runs hot when browsing the internet and also using GPS actively (GPS when in flight mode)
7 dual core, but so is my tablet that doesn't run hot (significantly hot)
 I wonder if the phone is a prefab or if the chip is overclocked (inferior chip running faster than advised) to save on money
 When I did notice the phone getting hot, it did consume more battery life that usual
 The instruction book and default settings are for HONG KONG though easy enough to go through the setup and make changes
This phone arrived fast fast great company
1 OS is very easy to use, and has a rather large selection of apps in the Microsoft app store
 Aditionally the phone often freezes and has an overheat problem
 Being mostly an android user, and before this being on iPhone 5, this phone was very easy to get used to
 It may not be as fast, but the screen size means I really don't need a tablet
 Works just fine one AT&T but not at LTE speeds
)It is fast smooth and certainly feels like a great phone

 Their communication was superb, and fast, they sent me a replacement with no questions asked
Good phone but after about a month the battery overheats constantly and phone starts acting wacky
 I have been using the phone for several hours now without the unusual heating up that happened with the original purchase

 After breaking my smartphone I bought this as a backup,
Very light phone good for Sameone who is not into smart phones
GREAT tough little backup phone to have around when your fragile smartphone breaks
Decent battery life (several days even after making multiple calls)You won't ever be caught ignoring your kids staring at a smart phone all day
Bought this for my dad who has no interest in a smart phone or anything fancy
 That also makes receiving group messages nearly impossible, as most smartphones send group messages as MMS instead of SMS
The SIM tray is easy to use; because it is a tray, not a slot, I was able to insert the micro-SIM from my smartphone without any trouble
The SIM tray is easy to use; because it is a tray, not a slot, I was able to insert the micro-SIM from my smartphone without any trouble
its ok is what i was looking for my dad very basic phone because he only use it to make phone calls no need an smart phone
 It was very quick and easy trip to the cell phone store to setup
You guys cheated both phones are locked
 I dropped it face down on the table, but my Nokia smartphone has been dropped many times and has yet to be damaged
, lots of "bars"), it's easy to use, and it feels well made
 I can dial a call in way less time than my touchscreen smartphone
 If I need GPS, etc, I take along my Nexus tablet, and can usually find hotspots along the way
 This is a great phone if you hate the complexity and frustration of a "smart" phone
This little phone is great, it does everything that a phone should do, is not a smart phone, but it does the job and I really like it
 I keep one around as a spare phone just in case one of our smartphones die unexpectedly
its ok is what i was looking for my dad very basic phone because he only use it to make phone calls no need an smart phone
Bought this for my dad who has no interest in a smart phone or anything fancy
EDIT: Changed my rating from 1 star to 3 stars because this *does* work on T-Mobile, but only if you are in T-Mobile 2G coverage (900Mhz and 1800Mhz bands), which may not be the case even if you have LTE (smartphone) coverage
 I'm not technologically illiterate by any stretch, but I didn't like how smartphones kept me plugged into everything 24/7
Did the job just perfect for my dad he isn't even gonna try ta get into the smartphone world, he's like does it have numbers I can push to dial, get it
This phone is incompatible with MMS messaging, which your friends with smartphones may use from time to time

The only bad for this cel phone is that is no have wi-fi, but everything else is very good, is easy to use phone
 He's not into smart phones so I thought this'd be a good purchase
 Call quality is great and the interface is easy to figure out
 I got this for my mom who has no clue how to use simple functions of a phone but this phone was pretty easy to set up for her and she liked using it
This phone is great, light weight, easy to use, the camera is decent and it is very compact and fits in my pocket
 Texting is easy, the display is great and easy to see
 This is all I'm looking for, an easy to use and great looking phone
So far this phone is everything I expected; its easy to use, has a decent processor, stable software, good camera and lots of apps to download
I have seen many sites that try to compare this feature phone to smartphones and that would be a mistake
 This is NOT a smartphone (despite what Nokia tries to put on their website)
 That being said, it is probably the best non-smartphone that you can find that will not cost you an automatic data plan charge on your bill
 You see, I have AT&T as my cell phone provider and they will automatically charge you a data plan once their computers recognize that your SIM card is in a smartphone
 I made that mistake when I bought a smartphone without knowing their policy and I was automatically put on a data plan for that month
 At that point, I put my SIM back into my old Samsung and sent the smartphone back
Then I started doing heavy research to find a phone that would provide me with many of the same features as a smartphone but would not be recognized by AT&T as a smartphone
 Compare this phone to other feature phones, not smartphones and I think you will be very happy with your purchase
I got this phone for my wife and so far she really likes it, it is easy to use, stylish, has many features, very good reception (our provider is att) & the battery life is very good as well
 It is not a smartphone but it has a very good browser with excellent wifi access, internet radio etc and it does an excellent job in features that I usually use in my Sony Xperia ion smartphone with a price much less than a classic smartphone
I bought this because AT&T is raising smartphone prices to unfair levels
 This is the closest thing to a smartphone without actually being a smartphone
 It cost a third of what my smartphone was costing me and has most of the features
2 MP)-Wi-Fi-Pin Code Lock-Internet Radio-Data ManagementCONS:-Pain To Set Up-No front camera-Not many apps-Only A 2GB SD Card-No Brightness Control-Small Screen-Non-Removable BloatwareI would reccomend this to someone who is willing to sacrifice some smartphone luxuries without sacrificing them all to save a lot of cash
Not all the features found on modern smart phones but it does the job and well
 Recommend for anyone needing a smartphone like device at a budget price, since it still has web browser, whatsapp, internet radio, angry birds, etc
 It is very light, easy to use, and delivers great call quality
If you are expecting this to be a smartphone, you will be thoroughly disappointed
 I also like that I'm not locked into a data plan like with smartphones
 I hardly use it and it maybe lasts for a few days
 There is hardly any app for free in this app store
 Pretty old style and hardly anything to modify (you can use your own ring and message tone), but therefore you have a phone that will be fast no matter what and can use WiFi

Very fast and works with all carrier gsm in Venezuela
 I am very satisfied with the speed of this smartphone
 I am very satisfied with the speed of this smartphone
It will be hard to go back to regular digital cameras after using the camera on this phone
Very simple and easy to use
Pros:--battery life--solid voice quality--quick and smooth operating system--good predictive texting--threaded text messages--simple mp3 player--flashlight--web browser so slow you'll never be tempted to use it--little 2mp camera good enough for quick, unimportant picsCons:--has web browser--buttons a bit small (though I have huge hands and don't really have a difficult time navigating the buttons)--can't delete apps from menu--AT&T about to take down 2g network, leaving only TMobile's
 Clear phone call quality and easy to use Nokia OS
Good reception, good photos, but the headset does not fit well
 I took it into a retailer and they were able to fix it so I could send photos, the only problem is that it can't download large photo images from smartphones (and that's what everyone sends photos with these days)BATTERY IS AMAZING

 It's definitely not a smart phone
I wanted a cheap a nonsmart phone, and this phone works
 The case is totally smooth, I could see dropping it very easily, although I would expect it to survive
Excellent phone for easy handling, money well spent
 the delivery coming very fast
I'm gonna add a few photos of the cellphone, I hope it can help you to make a better choice
Darn hard to open the back cover; in fact, I couldn't open it without taking atool to it which would most likely ruin the product
 For me, regardless of how well it functions, for my purposes, the hard to open back cover was the deal breaker
 The item served the purpose and it's easy to maneuver
The phone was delivered on time and is perfect to people who don't want to take the step into a smartphone
This Nokia phone is lightweight, has great call quality, and has a removable battery (something you don't find in smartphones these days), and a micro sd card slot
Not a bad phone when your not into smart phones
 I found the keypad somewhat small, with the keys grouped together tight, so might be hard for people with dexterity issues
works great, easy setup, no problem with sim card

 The phone was easy to use and I slotted both her Thailand GSM Simcard and purchased a GSM simcard from Walmart Mobile to use here stateside
 This was a little annoying but it was easy to choose the correct SIM Card after labeling them
 The battery cover is easy to remove but I do it breaking if you're a power user with a spare battery and you want to constantly swap the batteries out with a fresh one
 It would make a great hot spare if you have to have your 600 dollar whatever phone serviced or lost
it was small, easy to use and very useful for international travelling
 the sim changing part was very easy while on journey
 Ships fast and received fast even on standard shipping got the phone in 2days
 This is really good for traveling and if you work challenge jobs, so you don't need to fiddle through menus and apps like a smart phone
I have I very good review for the Milestone, but this another was a gift (for someone that cannot use a smartphone)But this just start the logo and then goes out
 All keep asking for a smart chip
The phone I received was slightly different that the product photo
 Small light, I hardly notice it in my pocket
 It's unlocked, and I'm outside the US, and it was quite easy, I just slip in the sim and it worked perfectly with the local network
 It's easy to use
 Oh well, it was time to join the smartphone generation anyway
Nokia is a very easy to handle, the soft keyboard is not complicated
The phone does not have a vibrate function and had a hard time keeping signal
Product arrived fast
 This cell phone is pretty easy to use for her
 There are not many to choose from, this Nokia turned out to be a very nice phone gets great service and is easy to set up
Pro-screen is good sizefairly easy to use if you do not have eyesight issuesswitch out mini sim card for easy set up
ConsMenu button is not easy to use
 Other phones have easy to read arrows for menu navigation
 She needed a keypad that was easy to look at, and for phone use only
 The 2720 screen is terrible, I can hardly make out anything that is on it and I dread the task of entering contact information
 the only drawback for him is that he's a bit hard of hearing and the volume is at it's highest and he still thinks it's a bit too low
 Shipped very fast, and the most important thing, my dad loved the present
Product is very easy to use right out of the package
3 megapixel cellphone camera since I already have a Canon PowerShot SX210IS 14
 It is easy to carry as a second phone
 It will text and call, but will not send or receive photos
 not matter how hard the people at unlockedcellphonekings tried to help me, it was no use
 They were very patient, helpful and easy to talk to
 Very solid, and easy to customize all the tones and styles
For those who want a smart looking phone without all the razmataz features that require a PHD to learn, the Nokia 2720 is a good choice
 Good ring tones, easy flip open
 It's a simple phone that is easy to use for phone calls and texting
 Numbers easy to handle

 My provider said the identification number labeled it a smart phone which it was not
This is a great low cost cell phone, and it is really easy to use, small and lightweight
 I was looking for a simple, easy to use phone similar to the V195, because he's not tech savvy, and for him, the simpler, the better
 In terms of actually using the phone, they're both easy to set up and easy to use
In terms of a simple, easy to use flip phone, the 2720 does a good job, and these types of basic phones are becoming harder and harder to find
In terms of a simple, easy to use flip phone, the 2720 does a good job, and these types of basic phones are becoming harder and harder to find
 The one inconvenience, as another reviewer pointed out, is the fact that there's no USB outlet or removable memory card on the 2720, so even though it takes photos, there's no simple, direct way to GET the photos from the phone to your computer
 He likes the phone, however, it can neither send nor receive photos via text message
 I have no idea what this particular inlet model is called but I took a picture of it and will post it in the product photos
 (But it needs extra hardware
 The phone heats up so much after five minutes of conversation that it's hard to hold
 The phone heats up so much after five minutes of conversation that it's hard to hold
I like this phone, simple easy and handy
 But the volume is so low its hard to hear
UI response is very fast, you don't have to wait while media player is opening or smth else
I managed to connect it to Nokia PC Suite (not Nokia Suite) to copy new music, but I found thatjust copying mp3 with tags to corresponding folders on Micro SD card is faster and easier
Photo size is 1536x2048
Photo camera is very good too - self portrate, panorama, smth else which I'm not going to use
Simple photo editor
Photo gallery supports timeline mode - see photos specific to this date, press right and left to go to next/prev date
 Battery life is amazing compared to my smartphone and I'm saving a ton of money each month by getting rid of the smartphone
 The phone worked well, it was very high quality for a feature phone, and had plenty of apps that made it border on the realm of a semi-smart phone
I downgraded because the smart phone is such a hog of time
 The menus and organization is all over the place, probably because I'm used to smart phone, so it takes some familiarizing
I recently bought a Samsung Rugged II to replace this while I duke it out with AT&T whether this phone is "smart" of not, and feel like I am poised to lose the battle
 It is not a smartphone, but I did not want to have to pay hefty monthly fees for a smartphone
 My major complaint is what appears to be a hardware issue with the phone that I've read about in other venues since experiencing it: the screen intermittently goes completely white and the phone will not respond to anything
easy to use and kind of pretty (for the price)my mom is really happy
 The screen is nice and the buttons are easy to press
 The build quality is just amazing, it feels solid like a brick except that it's easy light and nice to hold, it feels great in your hands
 This is a semi smart phone because it has certain social networking apps so it can be useful for people who are new to the smartphone business or are light users
very nice to use a wonderful semi-smart phone
 I've never had a smart phone, so can't compare the sound quality to a high-end phone
 I have not yet found where you can choose to mute alarms for a period of time, like when in a theatre
 You change capitalization by clicking "#" but if you click it too fast, you turn on/off predictive text
 Compared to smart phones, this phone is pretty cheap at about $85 out-of-pocket, but since I am one frugal mama, that is still expensive to me, especially if it is going to crap out after only a year or two
 I might have been better off with an older high-end feature phone - one developed before smart phones took over the market
 I know I will be forced into a smart phone sooner rather than later, but I found I definitely like this phone better than anything else I can afford right now
 Every time my friends can't get through to make a call with their smart phones, it's my Nokia they want to borrow
 Nothing like a smartphone today though
 This phone is really easy to read, has good bright screen that seems to be scratch resistant so far
My mom really wanted to get a smartphone
but AT&T told me that its considered a smartphone BECAUSE it has Wifi and a touch screen
 Hopefully someday I can get my mom on the smartphone bandwagon
 So far it's been a great, easy to use phone
I just use this as an awesome pay-as-you-go "Voice Phone" to supplement my work-supplied smartphone with unlimited voice/internet
 I just wanted something small and easy to slip in my pocket, because my old E51 can only hold about an hour charge after 5+ years
 I like that this is a simple phone (not a "smart" phone, has no touch screen, menus are easy to navigate) but has all the features I need in a phone
 I like that this is a simple phone (not a "smart" phone, has no touch screen, menus are easy to navigate) but has all the features I need in a phone
 It was very easy for me to set this up with my contacts and plug into my (Windows) computer to install custom wallpapers and (MP3) ringtones
 The camera is decent, seems to take better photos than my old phone did and the camera has more settings than the camera on the 5310 did
 I have T-Mobile service and it was very easy to simply switch my SIM card to this phone from my old one
 The USB cable (Nokia model CA-101) from my old phone worked perfectly with this one to connect it to my computer and drag/drop files and photos onto this phone
 My only real complaint about this phone is that it does not have full-screen photocall (like my old Nokia phone did) and it doesn't let me view photos as organized by folder from the mini SD card (just views them as if they were all in one huge folder unless you specifically save them to individual "albums" and then only view the album that contains the photo you want to view)
0 A Male to Micro B" for this phone and it is very nice quality cord that worked perfectly with this model of phone so I could transfer MP3s and photos and such between the phone and my Windows 7 computer
 I'm not a fan of "smart" phones or phones with touch screen
 The construction is good, but I got a better signal on my 6-year-old Nokia 5310, and it couldn't read the music and photos on my SIM card, only the address book
The Good:+Works with AT&T 3G and works as a VERY fast modem when you connect it to your computer
+Camera is good and fast for a 3
 The features are better than other basic phones and this phone is very fast
 It has the same camera, but it has a smaller screen and the 3G is not as fast
 You can get about 1 day of battery life, less than what I get on my smartphone
 I would recommend a C2-01 over this phone as it is a better all around phone, but slower 3G speeds
"Aka smart-phones"
I purchased a few of these phones before I finally went to a smart phone
 The manufacturer label (and label under battery cover - see photos) showed clearly that this was the 301
 It's replacing my Nokia Lumia 520 which I have used for a few months now, but am starting to get tired of all the carriers fighting about smartphone plans and wanted to get myself out of that mess by ditching mine and going on the GoPhone feature phone plans
The phone itself is made out of this really nice and smooth premium plastic
 The keypad lights up and is very easy to use
 The best thing that you can push things to the SD card for easy exporting
 but still, lasts way longer than the new smartphones' batteries
Its fast, photo is very good
Its fast, photo is very good
It's classic Nokia - solid build, clear and logical user interface, real keyboard, good size clear display, camera that's fine for the occasional quick photo and it's affordable
An avid smartphone user for 6 years now, I bought this 301 this week to augment my Berry for those weekends and other times when I don't need the full pocket computer rolling
I don't see this replacing my smartphone needs with work and such, however it has been a joy as a number two phone, ideal for those nights out when you are expecting a phone call/text and may want to hop on the web while waiting in line or whatnot
 I wish that it would be sold in stores, however I'm a happy Amazon customer and this device seems to hit a nice medium between "dumb phone" and "smart phone" with sharp, near landline call quality and quick T9 typing
With the ability to quickly swap out the SIM from my Berry to this 301, I've got a fun and useful duo for the same price as compared to upgrading to popular 32 GB models of other smartphones, while using the latest iterations of some longtime players in this still, relatively new field

 I would recommend a C2-01 over this phone as it is a better all around phone, but slower 3G speeds
It's very easy to use, nice and small and is GSM so works in Europe too
 That person does not want or need any smartphone functionality, and for this purpose, this phone is a perfect replacement
The software is also minimalistic but pretty functional, with all functions required by such phone working perfectly and easy to set up (you have to do a little bit of typing setting up MMS/WEB gateway settings for AT&T network (visit AT&T's official forums, the Nokia section, to read about necessary settings), but if you don't need these functions everything else is pretty self-explanatory and don't require any "user manual" or Google searches to set up)
 The built-in camera works well for its intended function - obviously not as good as similar cameras on smartphones but better than majority of cameras on other non-smartphones
 Overall it is one of the best non-smartphone models I have ever had pleasure dealing with and I highly recommend it if all you need is to make calls and maybe occasionally send/receive a SMS/MMS message
 The camera is nice and delivers great photos, but when I am on a call and someone calls in via call-waiting, there isn't any tone or beep letting me know someone else is calling me
 It is about equivalent in picture quality to a throw away snap shot camera
 My wife did NOT want a "smartphone" and this one works perfectly for her
 Do NOT expect great photos, however
 OK for quick shots but not for more important ones
 The Nokia's speed dial (unlike the LG LG230 Dimson) is able to assign different phone numbers belonging to the same person (e
 a speed-dial number for your wife's work and a speed-dial number for you wife's cell)
 "John Smith, Mobile"PROSExcepts up to 8GB microSD RAMSpeed dial number oriented (allows more than one speed-dial number per phone book entry)Works well with Bluetooth: Tested with Bluetooth Headsets Jawbone ICON and Plantronics Discovery 975FOIBLESBattery CoverAs with other evaluations, the back of this phone is (putting it mildly) DIFFICULT to remove once the battery is inserted
 It is easy to set up
Excelent smartphone
 For a 2mp camera photos are pretty good, but no flash though, but I can live with that

 For a 2mp camera photos are pretty good, but no flash though, but I can live with that
 So, since I am no fan of smart phones, and frankly there is no other rugged phone (with termometer, compass, flashlight, noise meter) that is available in Europe I was amazed to see the new 5140s on Amazon
My rating is 3/5, mainly because I want to give it a shot, see how long it will last
Regarding the phone itself, it's a decent inexpensive smart phone
 It has all the features you would want in a phone -- excellent camera, super-fast GPS and mapping features, very large storage capacity, etc
 I never owned a smartphone before, so I must say I love it
Hotmail ActiveSync -- Exchange implementation on this phone only partly supports hotmail activesync
 After doing a software upgrade (which wasn't obvious) on the phone its hotmail email support is actually not bad
 It also synchronizes with hotmail calendar, but only the main calendar, couldn't figure out how to synchronize with other calendars (like the birthday calendar)
 I don't think it supports custom folders on hotmail though
 The menus and features are quirky and hard to use
 The display is not the great and games or any add ons and programs are either non-existent or hard to find
 Moreover the scrolling is not easy
 It has any feature you could want except wifi but this phone is NOT considered a smartphone by AT&T so you DO NOT HAVE TO PAY THE $30 DATA PLAN FEE and you can use the $10 per month unlimited data
 I bought this phone for my husband because it seemed like the best alternative to an iPhone and similar touchscreen smartphones without the issue of having to pay the ridiculous "Smartphone Plan" fee
 It has fast response time from input or touch
 The internet works great on this phone and is fast in our experience
+ intuitive interface super easy to use+good for a touch-screen beginner (hybrid between traditional and modern selective methods)+superfast camera+nice video quality+decent display+very light and compact, good design+comes with a pick for small objects on the screen (awesome)-not a very responsive touch-screen-image quality is sub-par-no flash ( are u serious

I've used this same model of phone before, it's not a smart phone but I like it because it's small and light
 Easy to clean, easy to use, very good function under tough job site conditions
 Very good phone for everybody who doesn't want or need a smart phone
Although not a "smart phone" this compact device is feature-packed with a camera for stills and video, a real music player, a real FM radio using your headset as its antenna, Bluetooth and USB, and data storage on a mini SD card
Overall this is a must buy for those people that want a smart phone with out changing your plan
 If you are looking for something easy to use and your main thing is the touchscreen maybe you should look for another phone
 mixed feelings tough, nice to have one, hard to master it, weak reception7
- The menus are very easy to get used to, very well organized, and you can still change their order or create folders to your own preference
 In N81, you could make albums, navigate over the photos and edit them in few steps, but now, the 5800 does not offer you the album option, you can make a folder and put the photos in, but if you want to rotate them you can quickly do it but won't save the image like that, you need to go the edit to change it, which involves 4 or 5 steps, and once you save it, it takes the image out of the folder you put it in
So then, why is that I am giving this hot toy 3 1/2 stars
Regarding crashing
- In several occasions it has crashed, meaning that you hung-up a call and freezes, the solution is take the battery off and put it back
 The camera produces excellent photos but do not rely on the auto mode to give you the best shots
This is an excellent smartphone that my son is completely happy with after 3 weeks of use
 I guess the antenna is shot
I bought this phone thinking that it was one of the best phones but after three months it started to heat and the battery lost all his energy
The Nokia 5800 XPressMusic is smart, with good quality and complete
Notable are the Carl Zeiss Camera, GPS Navigation capability andultra-fast EDGE Internet connection
Is one of the cheapest middle-high-range touchscreen smartphones
For a first "smart phone" it's okay
 I still text faster the ol'school way using the predictive text and the alphanumeric pad
A bit of deception because finding applications to it is not as easy as for Android (this runs Symbian), but these do not make me think it is a bad choice
 It helps that I never use any smart phone features because they're such a PITA
 Speakerphone very good, yes OVI is a nightmare but overall a good quailty and fun phone, touch screen is a little hard but not bad
4) Forget about trying to take photos in less than perfect lighting- they will look grainy
the touch screen is not as fast as an iPhone, but everything is compensated for all services that does not carry the iPhone, I'm really happy with my purchase and the truth I do not change my Nokia 5800 with iPhone neverThe flash of the camera is really strong,The design is ergonomic and fits comfortably in your hand
 What I need is a smart phone with a real GPS, instead of A-GPS that requires a data plan (most of US data plans become horribly expensive in Europe)
 I mention this because it is hard to communicate back and forth
 It's just something to consider if you are looking at this as an international travel phone and a fast data connection is important to you
 Find a free hot spot at a coffee shop and you can check your email, tweet, update your Facebook and make Skype calls back home
There is no question that Nokia delivers great hardware value with their handsets
 The challange for Nokia will be to develop a operating system with plenty of apps that let's the user smoothly and easily take advantage of all that great hardware
 The challange for Nokia will be to develop a operating system with plenty of apps that let's the user smoothly and easily take advantage of all that great hardware
 It has 3G tec, batery life is also good, menu is friendly and easy to work
 Because it's an unlocked phone, there were a handful of useful things I could that iphone users couldn't, like download an app that allowed me to take my 3G connection and make a WIFI hotspot
 OVI Suite crashes, Windows closes it, and my phone is now a paper weight
 You need to press much harder on the LCD so fat fingering is very common
 That is easy to overcome, as far as Applications are concerned (you can override him with your voice), but I am yet to figure out how to change the preconceived notions, as far as "Contacts" are concerned - I cannot figure how to create a voice command to call my wife, unless I mimic the Finish guy's ideas as to how to pronounce a name
 Haven't downloaded all the Nokia apps to check out all the functions this smartphone can do
 Expanding memory is easy with a phone slot on the side to max out to 16 GB
 for a smart phone virgin
 It's pretty easy to use for someone who has never had a touch screen before, and even has a help screen in every section plus tip video clips
 very hard to navigation around
 And with great relief, I tell you people that this Nokia 5800 Nam is an outstanding smartphone
 So I do turn it off to keep it running smoothly
 This is a best seller for Nokia, therefore they will continue to give us better software updates to make it run even smoother
 The phone feels so easy fitting in one hand
 As for the touch method, the iphone once again is kewler and smooth however the resistive touch screen is CLEARLY improved and does not hold you back
Ever since I have used smart phones, nokia and symbian s60 has been my favorites, my last two phones being the n95-3 and the e71
 Not a major overhaul on the operating system basically everything looks the same as previous nokia smart phones, the camera, video, and music interfaces could have made better use of finger controls in my opinion
 I had to perform a hard reset and remove the memory card in order to have the phone boot up properly
 Sync with Google Calendar and contacts fast and excellent
Well I would love the IPhone's beautiful and smooth interfase (which is far better than any other) plus snooze options for remindersToo much and too good to be truth
The Nokia5800 XPress is really an outdated smartphone for a high price
 Save the money and get a smartphone of a newer generation or keep the old cell phone and get an iPod touch
 Easy to use, easy to install new and cool applications like GPS maps and games
Source (Thanks to Nigel):I have a nokia N80 smartphone with the latest firmware (v5)
 A very smart phone now
 I also recommend installing all except critical software to the memory card - makes it easy to disable in case of any problems-- Nigel
 Only negative point is the side's of video and photo, because i can't turn to right side to see a video, for exemple, it has only left side default
This phone crashed all the time
 Each time it crashed you lost data and you had to reconfigure it
 I spent over two hours on the phone with AT&T representatives, supervisors, tech level II people, and finally after trying everything, they concluded that this is a smartphone and needs a data plan
 So it should be listed as a smartphone 
Does just about everything a smart phone does without the expense of adding a data plan
 Just not the smart phone price
But if you are new (as i was to smartphones) this one can do many tricks
I have used lots of different phones, from the basic Razr flip phone through several different Windows Mobile & Blackberry smart phones, and even the greatly over-hyped iPhone, and this is by far my favorite phone
 Well, it's really just a "feature" phone (aka dumb phone) posing as a smart phone
 As a media device it features second to none audio quality (with good encoding and headphones it sounds incredible), and a truly amazing screen for photo viewing and video playback
 Dual-band high speed HSDPA 3
 Photo browser
The 5800 XM runs on Symbian S60 v5, a true multi-tasking smart phone OS
The phone is great, & easy to figure out & use
 Uploading and playing music is easy and intuitive
 The computer interface is easy
3 not easy to access the lists like phonebook
you are unable to stop on contact you want from scrollbar it run too fast
 anybody in your family or friend can access you photos,videos,masseges etc there is not even a simple pasword securiy on phone
I really really love this smartphone
 The apps, are wonderfull and easy to navigate
 I'm afraid of plastic phone, but I'm impressed with this phone-Very fast 3G-Mail for Exchange
-A lot off apps in Ovi Store-The phone is fast, even with the 16gb microSD
 Large storage space that is easy to interface with the PC
 I wanted a reasonably priced smartphone that allowed access to the web, made phone calls, had gps, a decent camera, etc etc that was NOT an IPhone
 The update wasn't easy as the settings were all incorrect
 The Sim card is very hard to remove as you have to remove the battery
 the virtual keyboard does not open to enter automatically and the camera takes nice pictures but does not open easily and you must go through several steps between shots to save the picture and take another
Shipping was very fast
 Phone is very nice but not so easy to learn
plus:for the price has good featuresworks mostly finegood receptioncons:slow response timeno "alphabet" on dial pad view (hard to call for ex
 sound quality is good, but the reason i gave it a 4 and not a five is that its hard to text from
This phone is great as a phone (only as a phone), easy to use, great for contact detail, good battery life (3-4 days with minimal use, 1-3 with moderate)great sound for media/calls and acceptable Wifi
 I travel a bit and basic phone Wifi is great to check emails and facebook at free hotspots
 My daughter does use all those other features, and they all seem to work OK, but what good is a smart phone that can do everything but text
 Alot of features are kinda hard to access so you have to read to find out, you cant just pick up the phone and know
 It has great features, easy access, and it works
 The battery life is pretty good for a smart phone
 Texting is not bad but is hard as the buttons don't respond right away, or if you turn the phone horizontally its nearly impossible to text
 This was a great choice and I recommend it to anyone who wants a smart phone
 It takes a little while to get acquainted with all the features and to learn your way around but once you do it's all smooth sailing from there
i spent a week online trying to figure out which smartphone i should buy
 i've never used a smartphone before and would have normally tried a few models
 it feels very clunky but since i've never so much as touched another smartphone, i have nothing to compare it to
is an excellent choice if you are looking for a touch screen smart phone, I've had a phew touch screen phones in the past but this is the best one yet, the only thing that I wasn't 100% happy with is the camera is not a very good one when there is not much light, but the rest is fantastic, the different writing modes are the best, you won't even notice it's a touch screen, berceuse you can blast emails and SMS messages like with a keyboard cell phone
5 g downloads the from the internet really fast and wi-if is pretty good
 with 16gb card can store a lot of photos, video and games
 It's a great smartphone and easy to use once you've played around with it
 It's a great smartphone and easy to use once you've played around with it
 Still working but I just bought smart phone to able to use better searching
 Weakness; Symbian OS, lack of apps in Ovi Store, Stability of apps, would crash due to bugs in apps,security issues not enough memory,lack of Customer Support for Nokia and Symbian in Northern America
 They had me perform a hard reset and update the software on all 3 phones multiple times only to have the problems return after a few days
 I eventually refused and explained to them that performing a hard reset and updating the software was not a solution
 When they returned the phone, I found out that their "repair" was to perform a hard reset and update the software once again
 Of course, the OVI share experience to upload all her photos and receive comments from her friends and family, was what made her happy
 This smartphone has everything required for a practical use of email, e-mail account wizards settings are very easily to use, and with the OVI suite you can have it all in one place
super long battery life, clean live sound from speakers, easy to use display and on-screen keyboard
 It's got everything you want from a smartphone
Firmware updates for the 5800XM seem to come every few months and the system automatically reboots after but there is also a soft reboot and a hard reboot if needed
 For my purposes, mostly music, appointments and alarms, and the phone, it is stable with just 1 exception when the battery overheated while I was talking on the phone and connected to my Wi-Fi
5G coverage (7 bars) but the browser still works faster over Wi-Fi
It has tactile as well as visual feedback (the key you press enlarges and there is a slight vibration that you can turn off), making typing on the large QWERTY easy and the XM remembers where I use the large keyboard and automatically brings it up with the apps where I use it
 It is just the right size and the rubber-like back makes it easy to hold on to
 Navigation's pretty simple and easy, unless you have banana shaped fingers
Pros:- The set up was fairly easy and straight forward
- Touchscreen was responsive and pleasantly easy to use- Price/feature is good compared with other models- Battery life seems to be quite decentCons:- Even though I didn't install much additional applications(nightstand + Opera browser), it kept generating this error "memory card full
 And the touchscreen is a bit hard to use with the fingers like touching an iPhone (I have an iPod Touch so I was waffling between this phone and the iPhone)
 I think the accelerometer is faster than my Touch, almost too quick sometimes
 Being upgradeable with its memory is a definite plus and you can even have many memory cards since it's hot swappeable, technically that is unlimited memory
 The web browsing is also great and fast, depends on the connection, I have not downloaded many applications, word and excel work fine and are good for working or having information on the go
 It is easy to lock and unlock the phone manually
 Calls are easy and call quality is great
 A prior reviewer said it is to hard to make a call, but I do not find that to be the case
 You can put pics or an icon for people you call frequently (I think up to 5) on the start screen or set up a speed dial number
 I find it easy to use the touch screen but you do need to apply some pressure - more than the iPhone, but it works great
 I love the display and the only thing i don't like too mcuh is the writing panel cuz I like to use the small one and it's a little hard to get every letter straight however the big one is very spacious and nice
As somewhat of a tech-head with an eye for detail and quality, I had searched widely to find a smartphone that offered the best blend of features and quality without breaking the bank
 What's more is the variety of apps available for the phone, I can recommend a few that I have found quite useful: Photo Browser, Handy Shell, Paint Pad, Phone Torch, Opera Mini, AccuWeather, QuickOffice, GoogleMaps and Fring
 I got six movies (both hi-def and mobile versions) for this price and they all fit on the 8 Gigs of hot-swappable storage that comes with the phone
 It shines in daylight conditions able to capture great photos and widescreen videos of surprising quality
Final thoughts and tips about this interesting piece of hardware center on its value, quality and reputation as a Nokia branded product
 Some say it rivals the iPhone, and honestly, it does have more collective strengths as a smartphone than does the iphone in spite of its resistive and non-glass touch interface
 In short I chose this phone and adore it now due to its form-factor (not too big, not too small), its screen, its expandability and flexibility, its hardware features (GPS, Wifi, audio) and most of all, its competitive price/quality ratio
-Sometimes the phone in landscape mode, when you want to scroll down or up for example in some setting, it is freaking hard
 Web browsing works well although not as smooth as the Iphone5
 The full digital keyboard is easy to use with the stylus (a bit tough for those of us with fat fingers
 I heard that something like 20,000 apps were supposed to be released on launch day but there is no easy way to know how many are really out there
Hopefully the amount of GOOD apps that are released will increase fast now that the store is open
 has almost everything you'd like to have in a smartphone, but they have changed slightly the interface so it's a little different from what you would expect from Nokia
The PRO's: Great resolution, camera and sound; integrated wi-fi; good memory capacityThe CON's: Poor capacity to arrange the menus as you wish; no easy use of the touch screen as Palm-like graffity
 The Video (which iPhone does not have at this time) is very exceptional as well; even more functional and better quality than the camera still shots (odd eh
This smartphone may surprise you
5G on AT&T's cellular network is rather fast
 Very convenient size and weight - easy to handle and fit in pocket
 Boots fast and applications open fast3
] which was extremely easy, now I get notification when I get new emails and I dont need to go through the web
 In good sunlight the pictures actually come out pretty nice, otherwise they are awful but you can tweak them on Photoshop or other program
The processor speed: The applications seem to be really fast

 Desde todo punto de vista este smartphone sirve tanto a jovenes como a ejecutivos
 Every single time they had a lame excuse like the wrong IMEI (had to send them the photo of the phone, even that didn't help)
 I had a hard time figuring out how it works (with wifi)
 I bought this phone largely because of the GPS, happy that I could get a GPS "smartphone" that doesn't require a contract
 Once it finds one, it has trouble keeping it locked and it seems to have a hard time updating your position on the screen while moving
 Not even close to I-Touch(very smooth)
 It is also fast, easy, and more technology
 It is also fast, easy, and more technology
 The UI is not as easy to use as an iphone so prepare to read the manual
 This isn't bad because wifi is hard on batteries
 The camera won't replace anyone's separate camera but is good for the random snapshots
 For the price I think this is a very good smartphone if your lucky enough to get a good one
 I'm a hardcore open source software user and wanted an unlocked smartphone which would be affordable and highly functional
 I'm a hardcore open source software user and wanted an unlocked smartphone which would be affordable and highly functional
 I'm an older person and perhaps just don't catch on as fast as younger people, but thought I would do better with a phone which was more "computer oriented
7) Short cuts on main screen make it really easy to get to contacts you use a lot
 The only issue I found is battery, if you surf internet, use bluetooth and gps all day your battery will die before before the day ends, but not big deal because all smart phones with same characteristics has same issue
 Best feature, no MP3 conversion required, if you have lot of MP3 files on hard disk just drag and drop in few seconds, we can play, phone comes with 8GB of SD Card, can upgrade to 16 GB, that's more than enough, I had used the N95 earlier which costs double this price, this is not a NSeries phone from nokia, but it had all the features + touch screen of N series phone at half the price
 It comes with lot of add on and Its not too big like iPhone and not too small, exactly made for using with single hand and I had replaced the blackberry phone used for Office with this and configured my Office outlook exchange server along with Gmail, hotmail and yahoo, how cool is that
]) is available for free, it connects yahoo, hotmail, AOL, Gtalk and Skype users all in one place and we can even make voice calls to online users
 It has the great sync software that syncs all your photos, videos, contacts, notes etc between phone and PC using Bluetooth, just switch on the PC and it does the sync automatically
 I can write faster then I can type when texting, and if you want to keep notes, memos, lists, etc
You can keep 4 contacts (with photo icons) on homescreen for quick calling, texting, etc
Internet is nice as well, picks up on my wireless internet fast, as well as quickly at the local coffee spot, but haven't used it beyond that
 Video and photos are sweet on the lcd screen
 Bluetooth makes transfer of photos and music from you computer to phone a snap
 Very easy to do
 If you like to text and want a full keyboard (or the ability to handwrite using the stylus), keep documents on your phone, (bluetooth is quick and easy transfer back to computer), want to enjoy videos and music (with great sound), like surfing the web, want a GPS (with no need for a data plan), and are a techy-gadget person like myself who couldn't pass up the idea of having a touchscreen, this is an awesome choice
 And this phone does that function flawlessly as well as letting me access the internet either via hot spots or through AT&T's 3
2 mg camera and video that are fun to use, 8gb of micro SD storage and easy USB connection to your computer for uploading your favorite tunes, which you can use for your ringtones
 Also, don't be concerned that this is an unlocked phone, its too easy to set up if you have an existing phone you are replacing
Well the nokia 5800 is a really nice phone, great price at amazon as always, a bit on the chubby side, but is very easy to use
Very easy to use, all the right functions
 The first phone I received did't charge, but Amazon replaced extremely fast at no charge with a new phone that works great
 It's light, beautiful and It is a really smartphone
 Another thing is that it has good coverage and I can clearly hear all the calls, and is very easy to find any contact likewise have no problem to download music in the library and update
 Functional, easy to follow manual, and does everything the write-up said it would do
Fast shipping from amazon, item was received faster than expected
 The Nokia 5800 is lightweight and very easy to use
 and very easy to use hand-free speaker
I really like this cell, I at the beginning I had a couple of issues with it but I did an upgrade to the latest software version and everything started to work great, it is really fast browsing and downloading stuff, I will rate this product with an "EXCELLENT"
 Amazon was very professional and speedy about the return and the refund, so 100% satisfaction with Amazon
 When I purchased the nokia 5800 I was surprised that the shipping was so fast
 Handwriting - I hate little dinky buttons and I can write faster than I can type7
 Turn your phone into wifi hotspot (joikuspot)Dislike:1
 All in all iphone is far superior hardware (and so it thrice as expensive unlocked) but your Nokia 5800 XM won't let you down
This is a really good phone for all of those people looking for a cheaper option for a good touchscreen smartphone
 Depending on how precise I am, sometimes I write pretty fast (Only a tad faster than T9 with predictive text) and sometimes I struggle a bit
 Also, the browser is more than decent, pretty speedy and you can also use Opera mobile 10 (not opera mini) which feels like a more full fledged browser than Opera mini and is also quite fast
 Also, the browser is more than decent, pretty speedy and you can also use Opera mobile 10 (not opera mini) which feels like a more full fledged browser than Opera mini and is also quite fast
Overall this is a must buy for those people that want a smart phone with out changing your plan
 If you are looking for something easy to use and your main thing is the touchscreen maybe you should look for another phone
 mixed feelings tough, nice to have one, hard to master it, weak reception7
- The menus are very easy to get used to, very well organized, and you can still change their order or create folders to your own preference
 In N81, you could make albums, navigate over the photos and edit them in few steps, but now, the 5800 does not offer you the album option, you can make a folder and put the photos in, but if you want to rotate them you can quickly do it but won't save the image like that, you need to go the edit to change it, which involves 4 or 5 steps, and once you save it, it takes the image out of the folder you put it in
So then, why is that I am giving this hot toy 3 1/2 stars
Regarding crashing
- In several occasions it has crashed, meaning that you hung-up a call and freezes, the solution is take the battery off and put it back
 The camera produces excellent photos but do not rely on the auto mode to give you the best shots
This is an excellent smartphone that my son is completely happy with after 3 weeks of use
4) Forget about trying to take photos in less than perfect lighting- they will look grainy
the touch screen is not as fast as an iPhone, but everything is compensated for all services that does not carry the iPhone, I'm really happy with my purchase and the truth I do not change my Nokia 5800 with iPhone neverThe flash of the camera is really strong,The design is ergonomic and fits comfortably in your hand
 What I need is a smart phone with a real GPS, instead of A-GPS that requires a data plan (most of US data plans become horribly expensive in Europe)
 It came loaded with easy to use software
 The 5800 is not too big and it is not too little, easy to navigate through shortcuts and menus
I was looking for a smart phone without a contract that doesnt cost an arm or a leg
 The built in browser is good and fast
The Nokia 5800 is a good phone but has its downsides:Pros:- Touch screen is responsive- The full keyboard is spacious- Has a stylus but isn't really needed- Feels sturdy- Comes with 8GB of storage- Decent camera for a cell phone,- Internet browsing is decent- Comes with Wifi and Bluetooth- Good music player/radioCons:- The memory card is very hard to remove
 If you want an internet device, go with the higher end smart phones (iPhone, Blackberry, Droid, etc)
 Also become heat when you use Wi-Fi for long period of time
This phone is good when you have a wifi hotspot at your home and work place
 I had to perform a hard reset and remove the memory card in order to have the phone boot up properly
 Sync with Google Calendar and contacts fast and excellent
Well I would love the IPhone's beautiful and smooth interfase (which is far better than any other) plus snooze options for remindersToo much and too good to be truth
The Nokia5800 XPress is really an outdated smartphone for a high price
 Save the money and get a smartphone of a newer generation or keep the old cell phone and get an iPod touch
 Easy to use, easy to install new and cool applications like GPS maps and games
Source (Thanks to Nigel):I have a nokia N80 smartphone with the latest firmware (v5)
 A very smart phone now
 I also recommend installing all except critical software to the memory card - makes it easy to disable in case of any problems-- Nigel
 Only negative point is the side's of video and photo, because i can't turn to right side to see a video, for exemple, it has only left side default
 The phone is a touch phone that comes with a little stylus, which is lost easily but very cheap and easy to replace if you buy spares on eBay
I have had to send mine in for service twice since I bought it, the first time for them to tighten the seams around when the phone locks and unlocks (it is a little switch that you push up to lock or unlock, which I find annoying and looks like it might break if you accidently push it too hard) which were coming loose, and the second time because my screen went black
 Browsing the internet isn't that smooth because the 5800's touch-screen is either overly sensitive sometimes or it just takes a slegdehammer to register an input
With the updates the phone functions a little smoother
It was really easy to put my SIM card in this phone, there's a slot right next to the memory card slot on the left side of the phone (instead of having it under the battery like in a lot of other phones)
Pros:xpressmusic buttonFavorite contactsPretty good pictures and video (sometimes)Really nice screen for viewing photos/videosQWERTY keyboardTouch screen feels/works greatMusic playerMusic tones8GB cardCons:No delete all button for texts and contactsAlarm clock settingsUPDATE: I did end up finding how to change the settings on the alarm clock to turn vibrate off
 I've tried a couple of my brother's phones and his are harder to control with scrolling, swiping, and accidently clicking things
I love music and photography, so this phone was MADE for me
For a first "smart phone" it's okay
 I still text faster the ol'school way using the predictive text and the alphanumeric pad
A bit of deception because finding applications to it is not as easy as for Android (this runs Symbian), but these do not make me think it is a bad choice
 It helps that I never use any smart phone features because they're such a PITA
 Speakerphone very good, yes OVI is a nightmare but overall a good quailty and fun phone, touch screen is a little hard but not bad
 I guess the antenna is shot
I bought this phone thinking that it was one of the best phones but after three months it started to heat and the battery lost all his energy
The Nokia 5800 XPressMusic is smart, with good quality and complete
Notable are the Carl Zeiss Camera, GPS Navigation capability andultra-fast EDGE Internet connection
Is one of the cheapest middle-high-range touchscreen smartphones
This phone crashed all the time
 Each time it crashed you lost data and you had to reconfigure it
 I spent over two hours on the phone with AT&T representatives, supervisors, tech level II people, and finally after trying everything, they concluded that this is a smartphone and needs a data plan
 So it should be listed as a smartphone 
Does just about everything a smart phone does without the expense of adding a data plan
 Just not the smart phone price
But if you are new (as i was to smartphones) this one can do many tricks
 I won't lie - while I find the features of today's smart phones finally starting to live up to the hype, I am just unwilling to pay 100 dollars a month for all the service and contract craziness that comes with it
3mp photo on my desktop without data charges, or picture texting charges
 I won't lie though, as with other phones, I wouldn't spend much time 'browsing' the internet - only things like checking email (easy with yahoo or google so far) or checking the weather, or seeking out an app make sense to me at the moment
 Otherwise, I have been impressed with the typical responsiveness and speed
 I've shot mostly indoors so far, and find that exposure ranges from unusable to good, grain is pretty bad in low lighting, but the flash is quite powerful
 I expect that like many cameras, broad daylight will reveal its best performance, and my good photos so far are really good
Excellent Call qualityCan act as a USB wi-fi hotspot if you have a data plan (is it time to drop Comcast yet
Learning curve - though not necessarily worse than other smartphones
All in all, when I got the GPS working the way I wanted, I fell in love with this little phone - it is a true powerhouse for the price, and if it lasts, I expect it will be remembered as my first great smartphone
 lately (though make no mistake, they are a world leader everywhere else, and innovative in their own right) and I fear that a switch to Meego and away from symbian will mean the general end of support for this kind of smart phone
 I feel like such a 'cheater' using this phone (buying direct from Nokia means NOT being FORCED to buy a data or GPS plan from my carrier) that I really wonder if the Nokia approach of providing an open and unlocked experience can really compete against the nickel and dime wireless economy being pushed by apple, at&t, google, verizon, and others
 It sounds good and it's easy to use
 Oh, the WIFI is blazing fast, as fast as my new laptop almost and the resolution is great
 The touchscreen is smooth, both the touchscreen and soft keypad are very responsive
 It won't fast focus or quickly adjust to changes in available light
 They claimed to run some diagnostic tests on it, which uncovered some hardware failures
 You need to press much harder on the LCD so fat fingering is very common
 That is easy to overcome, as far as Applications are concerned (you can override him with your voice), but I am yet to figure out how to change the preconceived notions, as far as "Contacts" are concerned - I cannot figure how to create a voice command to call my wife, unless I mimic the Finish guy's ideas as to how to pronounce a name
 Haven't downloaded all the Nokia apps to check out all the functions this smartphone can do
 Expanding memory is easy with a phone slot on the side to max out to 16 GB
 for a smart phone virgin
 It's pretty easy to use for someone who has never had a touch screen before, and even has a help screen in every section plus tip video clips
 very hard to navigation around
 And with great relief, I tell you people that this Nokia 5800 Nam is an outstanding smartphone
 So I do turn it off to keep it running smoothly
 This is a best seller for Nokia, therefore they will continue to give us better software updates to make it run even smoother
 The phone feels so easy fitting in one hand
 As for the touch method, the iphone once again is kewler and smooth however the resistive touch screen is CLEARLY improved and does not hold you back
Ever since I have used smart phones, nokia and symbian s60 has been my favorites, my last two phones being the n95-3 and the e71
 Not a major overhaul on the operating system basically everything looks the same as previous nokia smart phones, the camera, video, and music interfaces could have made better use of finger controls in my opinion
 I mention this because it is hard to communicate back and forth
 It's just something to consider if you are looking at this as an international travel phone and a fast data connection is important to you
 Find a free hot spot at a coffee shop and you can check your email, tweet, update your Facebook and make Skype calls back home
There is no question that Nokia delivers great hardware value with their handsets
 The challange for Nokia will be to develop a operating system with plenty of apps that let's the user smoothly and easily take advantage of all that great hardware
 The challange for Nokia will be to develop a operating system with plenty of apps that let's the user smoothly and easily take advantage of all that great hardware
 It has 3G tec, batery life is also good, menu is friendly and easy to work
 Because it's an unlocked phone, there were a handful of useful things I could that iphone users couldn't, like download an app that allowed me to take my 3G connection and make a WIFI hotspot
 OVI Suite crashes, Windows closes it, and my phone is now a paper weight
 Very user friendly & great for the individual who is looking for an easy to operate cell phone
the phone is great if you need a easy to do phone i just wish it was a little smaller to fit in my pants pocket better but its a good phone
easy to use, clear picture easy on the eyes
 My first time using a smart phone
 The main issue is the lack of an LED flash and it is easy to turn it off by mistake when it is locked
 However, the functionality and the capability are hardly noticeable when comparing the two in day-by-day operations (excluding the camera, because the Nokia 808 is an incredible camera that lets you make phone calls and organize your life)
 3) The HOME button is hard to use, as the CALL, HOME, and END buttons all use the same actuator plastic strip
 It even has a decent camera see the included unedited photo
 The only thing i don't like is that the gps has a hard time getting a signal indoors and when in a moving vehicle but it will still get you where you need to go if you're patient with it
If you just want a "smart" type phone, and don't much care about having access to tons of apps,this'll do
 Is not the fastest, or the greatest, but, for that price I thing it's quite good
easy to use, clear picture easy on the eyes
 My first time using a smart phone
 The main issue is the lack of an LED flash and it is easy to turn it off by mistake when it is locked
this is a compact, easy to use phone that does what it is supposed to
 This phone was so easy for her to function and no complaints so far from her :) Phone works great
 This phone is basic, easy to use, good size keys,good reception, and holds a charge for a few days
 Over all I totally recommend this phone to anyone who doesn't like advanced touch screen phones or those smart phones, this phone is perfect for someone who just wants it for taking pictures and talking on the cell phone for constant communication
 If you don't want a smart phone this is a good choice, and many are available at a good price
 I can take photo, they may not be top quality, but I'm not complaining
 It is a basic phone with large numbers that are easy to use
 Easy to use, easy to find , love the phone
 I only wish the pictures had more pixels; but, over the years, I've taken some great shots with it
Great purchase and smooth transaction
 Recommend purchase of this phone for the older generation that do not want a smartphone
 The keypad is very well designed and easy to use
 All-in-all this is a great back-up phone or perfect for folks that don't need or want a smartphone
Best of the non smart phones
hard to use
works for me, i don't need a phone that stands up and tap dances decent sound, once you get past the learning curve it is pretty easy
 She wanted a phone that was easy to answer and easy to hang up calls that didn't have an unlock code
 I dont like when someone cheats in this cheap way
I recommend it to anyone who doesn't use a smart phone
This phone might have everything you need and one might get used to it after a while but it's definitly not very easy to use
The Nokia 6350 is a good phone for individuals who do not want a smart phone
 It has an easy-to-use menu to navigate to set up the phone
 No fancy features, practical and easy
 Okay but seriously I love this thing, I bought this to replace a ( Nokia C3 touch and Type ) which has unbelievably tiny keys This one however is for me the phone of my dreams it is very easy to use and for it's compact size is loaded with tons of functionsMeasurementsLength 7 inches
 It takes photos, and records like a camcorder, this includes self timer, image sequence, brightness control, effects, whitness balance, and video share call16-There is a screen on the outside so you can see who is calling without opening the phoneAppearance1-Menu functions are easy to see

 2- Colors are attractive and easy on the eyes
5-Photographs look amazing very clear, perfect color balance, sharp clear details, no bluring or distortions6-Dialing numbers in a low light situation is made easy to deal with thanks to the great backlghting of the key board which is bright

 Unlike a phone I had in the past with yellow backlighting that causes eye strain this has white light like a lamp making it easy to see
 hearing people talking is easy, volume control is great and easy to adjust thanks to the volume up down key on the left side of the phone
it's easy to use phone
phone works great, just wish there was a way to disable the PTT button on the side as it is easy to push when getting the phone out of a case
The phone is fairly easy to use
 It was easy to set up the speed dial that he likes to use and he really enjoys the phone
 It was easy to set up the speed dial that he likes to use and he really enjoys the phone
My husband likes his Nokia Cell, however something is wrong with the battery and its off by itself every five to ten second and its hard to figure it out what's happening because no manual booklet came with the phone
This is good product, I'm happy to have a phone that meets my simple communication needs, is comfortable in my hand and easy to use
not my favorite real low volume and very fragile, hard to hear people
Very easy use phone without data plan, good quality from nokia
 too bad Nokia didn't continue develop better smart phone
It is a nice and easy phone
 It's small, easy to use and stylish
 But she did not want smart phone
 If you are looking for a simple and reliable cell phone without the complexity of a smart phone, I highly recommend this Nokia flip phone
 Way too easy to press, then you have to wait for it to tell you there's no data service (if no dataplan)
it is hard to charge, It does not recognize the charger which is a generic travel charger not the original
 Also, there's no easy way to access voicemails
As far as non smart phones go this one was pretty neat, good ringtones and what not
made my mom happy with this phone its so easy for her to use
Needed a non-smart phone to replace my mother's old phone
got it for my mother, who is not a fun of smart phone and finds it too complicated to use
 She loves it and very easy for aged people to use
I purchased this flip phone for my husband who refuses to use a smart phone
 I hated damn phone cuz it overheated, it went dead fast, I could barely hear people when I was talkin on the phone which pissed me off
 I hated damn phone cuz it overheated, it went dead fast, I could barely hear people when I was talkin on the phone which pissed me off
Good functional phone at a great price for anyone who does not want or need a smart phone AND no 2 yr contract
 Its a good phone but texting is hard since your using a 10 key phone pad
 It looks good, and is very easy to use
 Just like me she had a hard time using the touch screen, this phone is perfect
Nice phone very easy and simple to use
I'm again happy to have a phone that meets my simple communication needs, is comfortable in my hand and easy to use
 It is SO much easier to read and use than the "smart phones, and it easily slips into my purse
 The phone has great features and is perfect for someone who doesn't want a smartphone
Let me start by saying I hate smart phones
 Small things about this phone began to irritate me, like there is no way to turn the ringer off that I could find, so it could not go to the theater or church with me
 I have had a series of "dumb phones" -- I do not want a smart phone, but this one isn't even dumb
I got this for my parents , my dad got my mom a smartphone and she is just not into it, she likes the regular no fuss kind, I found this on amazon and it was everything she needed, I really loved seeing her face when she got it and could actually make and receive calls
Phone is very nice, easy to use
 It is easy to use but I find it does not hold a charge as long as my old Nokia phone did
 Also the volume on the side of the phone is a little inconvenient as I am hard of hearing and sometimes I hit the button and the volume is lowered by mistake
 hard to navigate
It made dad happy and that's not easy to do
 My husband doesn't want to do the 'smartphone' thing and had always had an easy flip phone, so when he lost his he wanted one a lot like it
 My husband doesn't want to do the 'smartphone' thing and had always had an easy flip phone, so when he lost his he wanted one a lot like it
This replaced an identical five-year-old ATT flipper so switching over was easy
- the numbers on the buttons and the screen are fairly easy to see
 I recommend this phone to folks who are not interested in smart phone features
 I just wanted to get her a simple phone to make and receive calls and it is so hard to find flip phones for the "older" generation to use
Great phone very easy to use simple I love it works well price is great to 
If not into smartphones there is no finer product if you want a flawless phone and quick to the point messaging
 I highly recommend this phone for anybody that doesn't want a smart phone but just wants a good, solid, reliable phone for calls and texting
 I love this phone and have bought it several times over the years, as it's easy to use and has a lot of unexpected features
very easy to open and shut quickly and small enough to easily keep in your pocket
This is my favorite phone, I love the flip design and easy too use
The phone is fairly easy to use
 It was easy to set up the speed dial that he likes to use and he really enjoys the phone

My husband likes his Nokia Cell, however something is wrong with the battery and its off by itself every five to ten second and its hard to figure it out what's happening because no manual booklet came with the phone
 Too bad because I like the simple model, the screen is easy to read and I can carry it in my pocket
