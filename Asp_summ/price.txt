This phone has all the features you will actually use as good as other phones and is at half the price
All and all for a two year old phone it is a great product at a really cheap price
If you're shopping for a new Samsung smartphone, but are shocked by the prices, you may want to consider this one
The price for this phone is really amazing, it does everything a phone twice as expensive does
For the price of $260 its a good deal compared to the phones that cost $600-$800
Amazon's 1c price for the phone definitely was truly great
This phone is a great deal for the price I paid
I purchased this phone hoping I could get a very nice smartphone at a good price
There are better phones out there, but this is a good mid price option if you want an unlocked Samsung phone
Amazing Phones and a great price
But like I said, for an entry-level smart phone WITHOUT extending your contract, you simply cannot beat the price, and the whole Windows Phone system is a wonderfully refreshing alternative to Android and Apple (IMHO)
Good unlocked phone for the price
5 GB of ram which isn't really noticeable unless you are heavily multitasking- Camera struggles to focus and stay focused at times but otherwise takes great photos- Runs android Lollipop right now even though Marshmallow is out (I hear they are releasing an update soon)- No active display or LED notificationIt's unfortunate that the market is saturated with phablets and we have very little choice when it comes to conservatively sized devices, but all in all I think this is a great phone (especially for the current price of $264)
It's worth every dime and the price was great considering that the phone looked brand new
The seller provided quick service, and I am very satisfied with this purchase and the price I paid
Great phone for the price, Looks like new very happy with the transaction

I like the phone, it's great for the price, but I'm writing this review to warn other buyers, the phone i got IS NOT NEW
Lots of app are available , so definitely i would recommend anyone who wants to buy a smartphone at a reasonable price
A great phone for the price but doesn't work well with H2o
This phone is great and I got it for a good price ($485)
This Samsung has the same powerful performance of the expensive smartphones at a very attractive price
Takes a bit of time to get use too, but for the price its a good buy
The product I got looks like new, I bought it new, and the price was reasonable, the cell phone came with all the accesories they announced, so I'm very satisfied with the service BLUETUKSA gave me
Overal great device and good price

Good product at a great price
I purchased this UNLOCKED Samsung Focus I917 with BUYING IT and definitively it is a great option to save money because offer the most important features that any expensive smartphones must have, but it cost less than 50% of them
For the price it was definitely worth the purchase
Outstanding phone at a great price
good smartphone and it's on windows 8 system works great an low price for this device , who want phone on win 8 but don't like nokia recomand this device
It was slow but it was worth the price
It was like new the phone was so reasonable price I brought two one for myself and one for my 12 year old daughter
I ordered the Samsung Focus I917 unlocked phone because the price was good and I wanted to test out Windows 7 OS
This phone meets all my requirements as for what I really wanted , all the specs this phone has , on another device or OS would have costed me at least 50 dollars more , and this phone has a nice style and windows phone runs quick in this phone , with android it would be lagging , but it runs very smooth here , I made a good choice since I lasted some time b4 buying a phone , and I did many comparisons in gsmarena
The price was great the phone came brand-new in the box with the accessories
So far the speed and features of this Zenfone 2 seems as nice if not better, and the price was great
Excellent phone at very good price
I would use this phone myself, I would recommend this phone to anyone to use, good phone for the price
Aside from that one thing, this phone is a great buy for the price I got it
Love this phone, the price was great
I purchased a refurbished unit for a very inexpensive price & it works great
Very nice windows phone, great price
really good price,,we send it to my mother in law to argentina unlocked and it works great over there,,best thing ever
The other day I had some trouble with my flip phone and there are very few new ones you can buy so I went to my carrier and what prices on these phones with contracts to boot
very good product is just what I expected, for the price I paid, I'm satisfied with the purchase, and would recommend to buy
Anyway I'm happy with my purchase because at that price I can't buy this product in my country
This is a great phone, and the price I got it for is literally unbeatable, but be aware that you might not get it right away
great for the price touch screen very sensitive but love the key pad letter are larger than my old phone
