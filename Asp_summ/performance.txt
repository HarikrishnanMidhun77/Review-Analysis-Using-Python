I got this phone because of the slider keyboard, the other phone I had was a good phone but my fingers were too big for the keyboard so I got the flight 2, the keyboard was perfect and after I figured out how everything worked on this phone (it didn't come with a manual ) it was/is a great little basic phone that has a smartphone look
All in all great for anyone starting smart phones
Great phone and shipped fast
Looks nice, fast, expandable memory, the camera takes a decent picture and battery life is quite good
Fast, great camera with a very good quality of the photo
Battery charge lasts a lot longer than my other smart phones as well which I like
I use this phone with pre paid straight talk and have no issue, phone works and so does the 4G and 4G LTE internet is blazing fast
Battery lasts 2-4 days, texting couldn't be faster, starts up fast, never freezes, cheaply priced phone, etc
The features are great, is very beautiful and easy to use
Havnt been able to drown it yet, easy to use sound is great good battery life i would recomend this phone to people that are hard on phones

I purchased this UNLOCKED Samsung Focus I917 with BUYING IT and definitively it is a great option to save money because offer the most important features that any expensive smartphones must have, but it cost less than 50% of them
the phone works great except it won't allow it to be used as a wifi hotspot on any network other than AT&T, i'm using it on Cricket's network that is owned by AT&T so i assumed that it would work like my old S3 did that was also on Crickets network but that was a UK unlocked phone that only had 3G not 4G LTE so i wanted a faster internet but i guess this wasn't the best way of doing it
Nice durable phone with large lite keys making for easy text or calls
If you are wanting to give a Windows smart phone a try this phone I highly recommend it
I bought this phone at first for me and love it, then I bought it for my family members and we all using it - it has evrerything that smartphone needs and the price is not hight; it works perfect
This phone does all I need - and more - and is VERY easy to use
Like the bigger icons and pretty easy to use
Windows Phone Mango is the most easy to use mobile OS you're gonna find, much better than Android, iOS, Bada, Symbian etc
I feel for the speed and overall look and feel and being unlocked it is a very good phone, feels a lot like a flagship model in operation also it doesn't offer all the bells and whistles some phones are currently sporting
It has a good touch screen and is easy to use
this was great it worked fine and the code was easy to put in love it ty will recommend to friends
Bluetooth works great for transfer of photos to my computer and contacts between phones
The screen resolutions is awesome, the camera is decent, easy to use, very thin

Since i got it, it is fast and so easy to adapt to Windows Phone
I think that the windows phone have future in the world of smartphone and this is a good product
yes , nice cell phone good work and speed in the applications, very recommended
This Windows Phone was very easy to use but too bad the software had a glitch
Phone is basic but I needed the rugged and waterproof features more than lots of smartphone stuff
Well, I had to leave my smartphone at home and start looking for a no-camera phone due to a new job
Samsung B2100 Unlocked Quad-Band Phone, Extreme Anti-Shock, Waterproof, Built-in Flashlight, Bluetooth-International Warranty-Blackthis phone is great it give it to my son and I am super happy with the purchase you make because it was fast I recommend 100%
So after researching a lot I found this phone and at a better price than with my carrier so I purchased it, came really fast with my Prime Membership and worked right out of the box, the only thing I had to do was to take it to my carrier because my old phone uses a micro sim card and this is a nano so no problem they gave it to me right away and worked immediately
For Neg's, I would say the speaker phone could be a tad louder, flash for night time shots would be great and wish I could get a solid 3 days of use, otherwise I keep a charger in the car just incase
This is a good hybrid phone ; sensitive touch screen , qwerty keyboard ( which I prefer over touch pads ) and lots of power to keep it viable in this day and age of high powered smart phones 
Pros: It's super fast, has a fingerprint scanner, takes an external sd card, can take your pulse, has a beautiful display, and was easy to set upCons: The menu buttons do different things than previous models which is still throwing me off, the auto brightness is way too dark in a dark room, there's still some bloatware that can't be disabled, and the ability to restrict app permissions was removedOverall I believe this was a great deal
Pros* Very nice screen, surpasses any other touch-screen I've used* Very easy to learn the functions included* A lot of customization options included in interface* Uses standard Micro-USB charger* Has X-Box live capabilities* A generous sized screen* Can use internet over WI-FI* Zune music and videoCons* Battery can sometimes only last for 24 hours* If on T-Mobile or other carrier besides AT&T cannot send or receive pictures* Low quality cameraAnother heads up would be that if you want to sign into your current X-Box live account, make sure to use the e-mail linked to that account or else it will set u up with an automatic account and you cant change it unless you proceed with a master reset :( i made that mistake when i first got the phone
I think is the best way to charge you cellphone is so easy and Work fast I will recommend to everyone I never used the normal charge anymore
It's touch screen so it's easy to use -- especially if you like to text
This is a great phone with all I wanted and I am not easy going
Because of all the buttons on the phone, it is quite easy to hang up or place a call on hold while in conversation, or perform a myriad of undesirable functions when trying to navigate to an application or task
It is hard to figure out how to use the question mark key as well as the exclamation key, but other than that, it is a really good phone
Great charger works great easy to use even with a protective cover over my phone it works unlike others I have tried this one really works 
my first andriod phone was the HTC ARIA I got on amazon, it was good the first week then I started having issues, like locking up texting, had to push hard on the screen, swiping wasn't as smooth and senstive as new
But, the small screen makes the navigation hard to decipher, and the browser lacked the functionality of the newer smartphones
Three points from my ordering experience: 1) check the vendor's return policy before purchasing; 2) when you receive the order check the phone properties first--it's easy to become enchanted with smartphones to the point of overlooking the basic on ear use; 3) buyers should reflect on the liklihood that any unlocked cell listed is actually new
it is easy too use it has a lot of good features
If you are looking for: quality, reliability, a big high resolution screen, fast processor, long duration battery (really
A little sluggish on the net but if you don't want to pay for a smart phone, this is a good choice
Whenever I get stucked on a waiting room or have time to spare and play candy crush (LOL) check my email constantly or use more internet troughout the day it will drain the battery faster but I can get to 6pm and it will tell me 15% battery remaining so this is a good thing
This is a very easy to use phone for those who enjoy using t9 and a full keyboard
Nice phone, bought it for parents, easy to use for them as they have never had one before
like the samsung blackjackII cuz its easy to use for me anyway i dont have to deal with the touch screen cell phone((:
Even if it has 2010 hardware, the phone is pretty fast, does everything you need it to do, and does it in style
Faster service by the seller and the phone is in excellent condition, good picture quality and easy to operate
I originally was using the Samsung S2 Galaxy for Sprint and wanted to return back to the Samsung EPIC 4G for Sprint because I really missed the keyboard, I really liked the smaller compact size of the phone, and I still needed some of the basic functions of a smart phone (i
I purchased this phone hoping I could get a very nice smartphone at a good price
Likes- 1-screen is fantastic; 2-web browser is extremely fast (I use my for product research in my historic art business, and am often trying to do quick artist searches in people's homes); 3-availability of Google apps that actually do something (rather than just the 'look at what my phone can do' apps that have no useful functions
The hardware on the phone was great in 2010, and still feels pretty good today
Works great, fighting to stay out of the smart phone market and this phone should give me a few more years
This is the perfect phone for my husband who does not need or want all the bells & whistles of a smart phone & is very hard on his phone, often dropping it in the toilet
Returned to amazon and got working phone in two days, easy

I have an android phone, and this one I ordered for my dad, who was looking for something interesting, easy to use and CHEAP, so I ordered the focus, and WOW, now I am hooked with the smooth and nice operating system and excellent pics and videos
Elegant, beautiful, fast charging, works with 110 and 220 volts, looks great on any desk
iPhone's and HTC's keyboard work pretty much the same, both respond fast and the size of the letters are good enough to type without making many mistakes
Pros:- Phone fits perfectly in one hand- Battery life last all day and in some cases two days- Phone works great on AT&T network and will probably work just as good on T-Mobile- UI is smooth and doesn't lag- Phone material has a very premium feel- Price is very affordableCons- Only 1
This phone is fast, the screen looks amazing and the sound is pretty impressive for a cel phone
Recommend it to anyone who needs a rugged easy to use basic phone
I had promised him one bc he doesn't like the touch screen smart phones, glad I was able to find what he wanted
Pros:-bright super amoled 4 inch screen-gorilla glass-light weight-solid construction-fantastic OS, smooth, fast, and the most important thing for me, bueauuuutifly designed-great price-fully updated with mango 7
Fast, smooth and great battery life
Other notes:*battery life-it's a smartphone, so don't expect much*speaker-just as loud as, maybe even louder than, my sister's galaxy s3*camera-5 mp not so bad, flash great , image stabilization okay, video quality only good in youtube 720 hd mode*no security lock for apps/text messages, threaded messaging(great feature)*3G connectivityMore updates later***
5 GB of ram which isn't really noticeable unless you are heavily multitasking- Camera struggles to focus and stay focused at times but otherwise takes great photos- Runs android Lollipop right now even though Marshmallow is out (I hear they are releasing an update soon)- No active display or LED notificationIt's unfortunate that the market is saturated with phablets and we have very little choice when it comes to conservatively sized devices, but all in all I think this is a great phone (especially for the current price of $264)
Phone is appears easy to use unlike many of the Android phones from the other companies
The phone is very light and sturdy but is kinda hard to text on since the qwerty key pad is very close together but other than those few things i like the phone
An easy to use basic phone that works on the 3g network
Windows Phone is always snappy and easy to use and understand
I got 2 Focus WP for one friend, but ive had hardware issues with them, the first one had an issue with the battery, it expanded without any reason, and the other phone has issues with the proximity sensor and light sensor somehow they got mixed, when there is lo light the screen goe off and when someone call he cant hang up the call, a very serius issue and i bought it from amazon, dam Samsung NEVER AGAIN
In short, I recomend the phone as it is easy to use and the camera abilities are great but don't pay more than $100 for cause if you are willing to spend more money than get the Galaxy III which I plan on upgrading to when my contract with verizon is up
The phone is great to hold, looks nice, works fast and smooth
This is a great smart phone for those of us who has limited requirements
I actually like the fact that it fits into my purse's phone pocket compared to some of the other newer smart phones and this is great for when I travel
I would rather use my digital camera and get better photo quality than a phone camera can give anyway
Needed a texting phone for work and did not want the $$ for smart phone
God knows I'm accident prone,I've dropped this phone so much since I bought it,it works great,nice little camera to,I have uploaded the photos to my computer and the look fantastic,you'd never guess they were taken with this phone
Shipped fast, phone was in great shape and working order
Lots of app are available , so definitely i would recommend anyone who wants to buy a smartphone at a reasonable price
Cons, No removable battery, no physical "home" button (to easy for my fingers to press the home button when typing a space), rounded back makes it tough to use when laying on flat surface, battery drains a bit fast, camera suffers a bit in low-light
I order this phone for my mother who needs smartphone with very basic function, reasonable price and small-pocket size
I love this phone, it's comperable to my Driod X, has decent battery life, a nice screen, is easy to talk on and surf the web, plus facebook and other apps

My husband does not like smart phones so this is great for him
The sound was a lot better than my previous phone and the operation on a touch screen is easy
I like the phone and all the features available on it i guess my only complaint is that e-mails are hard to read because the writing is small but having said that i am an old fart thatb uses reading glasses

I really like this phone seems like it is made really good, I do not have AT&T as my sever I have devote30 for $30 a month unlimited and taxing ,and this phone works grate ,it is a perfect size phone not to big or to small, I like that fact that I can go to another server and use it as long as they take AT&T phones ,,I can here nice and clear,,I just like this red color ,its charges real fast and the battery lasted all day and that evening I was on the phone for over five hours calling everyone and giving out my new number before the battery went dead it did beep to let me know the battery was low, I have no regrets getting this phone thinking of getting another one just so I have it for the future,, in case I brake or lose this one,,I really like the different headset plug in its different then most it's long and flat plug but seems that it will not ware out like the other ones do,,you do need to order the right head sets for AT&T samsung a777,witch Amazon has at a cheep price, witch I did and it works grate or you can buy the adapter,witch I also did so I could use my more expensive head sets on it as well,I also bought the case for this phone and it is well wroth it,
Did not want to spend the money for an unlocked smart phone but did miss having one at times to look up things as we were traveling
My hotmail account was able to be set up as an emaiil app(had problems with the iphone and windows phone) Driod is user friendly and you can arrange applications on different home screens
