It also had very poor battery life and every time the phone woke up, it said to check the back of the phone to make sure it was installed correctly even though it was
As far as the battery life, with heavy use I have had to recharge the phone after only 3-4 hrs and that is with the brightness set all the way down and only a few apps running
Picture quality is very low, and the battery life is short (about 1-2 days after a full charge with no data incoming)
Since you can link information from Messenger, Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter of your contacts, live tiles will tell you if anyone of your contacts in the group has shared something in any of those networks and you can make any comment or share anything you want without using any app, because everything is integrated in the OS, but not everything is perfect, now I have to charge the phone twice a day, actually now I have a charger at home, at office and the car (I hope there is a way to fix this because the battery lasts some time 5 or 6 hours, if you play a game then it will last 1 hour)
Awesome phone, battery last a lot, works very well, much better than S4
Long battery life, easy to use, very sturdy
Cons:Battery life: 1-day (You will have to charge the phone at night as an iPhone)HARDWARE NO GOODUpdate: March 17 2012Mine died like this: [
#The phone comes unlock#Cons cheap poor battery life only last one day and a couple hours long even if you dont use it that much for a new phone you wont get 2 and half day out of this phone when idle
This phone was sold with an old battery, I charge it and after talking for a little bit overhalf hour and I need to charge it again
Looks nice, fast, expandable memory, the camera takes a decent picture and battery life is quite good
The phone is great except the battery isn't very good
Battery charge lasts a lot longer than my other smart phones as well which I like
Havnt been able to drown it yet, easy to use sound is great good battery life i would recomend this phone to people that are hard on phones
It is perfectly functional, has good audio clarity and volume, good battery life with about three days per charge
I also notice that battery life lasts a little bit longer and charging the phone is much quicker than my Galaxy S2
I replaced a dead Samsung Sidekick with this, and the battery dies within a couple hours, with normal use
the first time when I could not start the phone, I connected the phone to computer and reinstall ZUNE and update -- do not know what really worked -- i tried these steps -- reinstall, remove battery and put in again, remove sim card, and put in again
I love my Samsung Focus, I bought it from IndyCellular4Less and I received in perfect conditions totally new unboxed, and it came in a retail box with battery, Wall Charger and USB Cable,I have no complain with it
(I eventually discovered that there's a little pull-down indicator at the top of the screen, but initially thought the battery or the charger did not work
the battery was horrible charge lasted 3 hours and the charger that came with it was broken and didnt even charge the phone in the first place
The only problem I seem to have with this one is that the battery doesn't seem to stay charged very long
The battery that came with my phone did'nt even hold a charge for a full day, the phone kept power off
Good battery life
Battery would last me 3-4 days without charging if i didnt use it at all
It looks nice and has some great features but the battery won't charge so I'll be returning the phone for a refund, since I can't get it replaced
I've always wanted a touchscreen cell phone, really love this one,only flaw is always have to charge it up,I've heard people put their phone on the charger every day,have not played around with it yet like the camera amd other programs this item rates way up there
For Neg's, I would say the speaker phone could be a tad louder, flash for night time shots would be great and wish I could get a solid 3 days of use, otherwise I keep a charger in the car just incase
Phone cames with hands free earphones and travel charger, wich has a usb connector, so you use the same cable to charge device or connect to pc to transfer music, pictures, videos and software updates via ZUNE
I was also pleased that the phone came with a battery, USB cable, charger, and earpiece
It looked like a new phone and works like a new one, including great battery life
Phone looks good but wouldn't stay charged, had to buy new battery
I really love my purchase, it perfectly works in Colombia, the only issue about it it's the battery life, I have to charge it twice per day
Installed the battery, Turned on phone, set up phone, and worked great
Even when it was fully charged it did not hold the battery life for long
I have charged my Convoy 2 once since arrival two weeks ago and I still have 4 bars of battery life
If you buy this phone, please order a new battery at the same time of purchase, you are going to need it
next thing is the charging portal, the charger would not stay connected to the phone everytime you want to use the thing you have to press the stupid little button on the side of it again and again to make it work one word to describe it
purchased this phone for my son - its a little bit bigger than a regular flip phonebut it is very durable and has great battery life, has some nice features and also a flashlight
After i broke my focus I bought from att, I tried to save a little money buying from amazon, i bought my replacement from blutekusa, it came fast like they said and in a different box then at&t woulda came in, after two weeks i tried to plug it into the computer and it said device was malfunctioning, they sent me a new one as said, second came with no plug for the wall outlet charging and after two days it wont stop turning on and off
* battery life is MAGNIFICENT, 5 days+ if you never use your phone or get it lost in a park over Thanksgiving Weekend
Battery life is also a big plus its last me all day and barely goes down when using my phone for internet,music or games and etc
I did do research for a while before making the purchase though and the reviews on this phones abilities were great with the only drawback being the battery life
The phone did come with a charged battery, European charger, North American plug converter, ear-piece & mic, and non-english instruction booklet (Polish I suspect)
In general it is OK, menu, camera is pretty good, but low battery and from time to time the phone works too slow
I got 2 Focus WP for one friend, but ive had hardware issues with them, the first one had an issue with the battery, it expanded without any reason, and the other phone has issues with the proximity sensor and light sensor somehow they got mixed, when there is lo light the screen goe off and when someone call he cant hang up the call, a very serius issue and i bought it from amazon, dam Samsung NEVER AGAIN
Phone worked great from October -2014 to July - 2015, now it shuts off and needs to be restarted by removing the battery
Pros* Very nice screen, surpasses any other touch-screen I've used* Very easy to learn the functions included* A lot of customization options included in interface* Uses standard Micro-USB charger* Has X-Box live capabilities* A generous sized screen* Can use internet over WI-FI* Zune music and videoCons* Battery can sometimes only last for 24 hours* If on T-Mobile or other carrier besides AT&T cannot send or receive pictures* Low quality cameraAnother heads up would be that if you want to sign into your current X-Box live account, make sure to use the e-mail linked to that account or else it will set u up with an automatic account and you cant change it unless you proceed with a master reset :( i made that mistake when i first got the phone
This one has a very strong battery which holds a charge for a very long time
I have owned this model phone for 3 years, and recently mine has begun functioning more slowly and losing battery charge quickly (<24 hrs with very little use)
Also, the battery that came with the phone must have been used, because it won't hold a charge for more than a half a day
What comes in the box:BatteryAC adapterPhoneNo DC adapterNo charging dockConstructionThis is solid phone with rubber protected buttons, and a sealed battery compartment
The unit I received had a bad battery that would not take a charge so I returned the phone to Amazon
I've never bought a phone from Amazon before for the soul reason of doubt, however this phone came in within 2 days, and was in a brand New unopened case with headphones, charging cord, battery and the phone
Once the batteries get broken in and have a few charges on them, I haven't had a problem getting through the day with them
It's a great device, faster and long battery life
Before running the phone I charged the battery and installed an additional 8gb micro sd card I got for 19
Battery lasts about 2 days on a charge as my mom doesn't use it for internet
I just leave the phone on the charger overnight and sometimes it charges fully, and others it's high 80's and 90's for battery life
Great phone shipped on time, new in original box with charger block, cord, battery and ear buds, along with all documentation
The battery lasts a lot longer than my last phone and charges up quickly
I think my phone came with a defective battery: it takes over four hours to charge
The battery for this phone only stays charged about 6 to 7 hours so sometimes it has to be charged twice a day
I have had my cel for a few days and it works well, it is exactly as advertise, but (and that's why the 4 stars) the battery gets hot a lot after 5 min of use, it shouldn't happen
It has excellent battery life and is quick charging
The battery charge lasts several days if you don't talk a long time
Not everything is perfect battery life is only for one day, you have to charge it everyday
Fast, smooth and great battery life
battery have problem donot hold charge for long
The phone was like new, and came with battery and a new charger
Arrived quickly and came with three different chargers and a fully charged battery
Battery life is comparable to that of a typical laptop or netbook type computer don't expect this thing to go days without a charge, but if you charge it daily, you should be fine
5 days with full charge, but if you don't required extended battery life this phone will be for you
My phones is 9 months old now ,has been in a lifeproof case since it came out of the box,never been exposed to water,moisture,dropped and it stopped working a week ago,I thought it was the battery so got new one
would not buy this phone ever again battery life
The phone did delivery fast, my major complaint is the battery life
Poor battery life for such an expensive phone
I'm looking for a better battery and I've bought additional charger and USB cables
* Battery life is great, average lifespan I experience is on average 3 days I have only needed to charge it 2-3 times in the two weeks I have owned it
Charged the battery and currently using as my Verizon no-contract phone
I like the phone, but I was disappointed that only the phone charger, battery and user guide was included in the box, I expected this phone to have the micro SD-card,hands-free head set and USB Data Cable included, this is the first time that I bought a phone and it did not include these standard accesories, other than that I like the phone, but I have to now go and purchase these accesories which should have been included with the phone
Works very well and battery lasts long enough to make it through the day if you use power saving feature
I love this phone, it's comperable to my Driod X, has decent battery life, a nice screen, is easy to talk on and surf the web, plus facebook and other apps
The battery that came with it was loosing conection and turning phone off, they sent a new one and haven't had any problems
If all you want is phone and text, this is excellent, battery needs charging fairly often
The battery on the phone doesn't hold a charge for more than a day, even with minimal use of phone
It came in the original Samsung Box, no AT&T branding, I received a USB cable, an Earpiece, a Battery, the Device of course and a charger to power this beauty up
Nice phone, fast, excellent battery life
-- i put the original battery in, did not come back, connected to computer update ZUNE again, not work, finally, remove sim card, and put in back in === it came back to life
Excellent phone: light-weight, small enough to put in a pocket even while in a sleeve, superb contrast in display, great battery life, sound quality, and fast processor
Love it , the battery life lasts longer than my smart phone
The only "not good" thing about this phone is the battery life, it last 1
The phone arrived way before the expected time in condition described by the seller; new with charger, samsung headphones and usb connector
The screen is nice and the battery life and signal is better than my Droid Charge, that broke
Meet needs as just a more efficient phone but with same capabilities as the old phone did that was losing its battery life
(I am used to having a plastic bodied phone so this was a great upgrade)-Battery life lasts almost two days and charges very quickly-Beautiful Samsung screen (of course)-Last, but definitely not least, it's CHEAP
