Yet, I am still searching for a phone without the touch screen
Touch screen is not very responsive
Pro: amazing amoled screen display
Likes- 1-screen is fantastic; 2-web browser is extremely fast (I use my for product research in my historic art business, and am often trying to do quick artist searches in people's homes); 3-availability of Google apps that actually do something (rather than just the 'look at what my phone can do' apps that have no useful functions
The screen is beautiful, Super AMOLED making the display rich in brightness and color
The picture looks amazing, the sound is great, and the touch screen seems better than an iPhone
-Excellent screen--looks great, very responsive
I bought this phone to replace an identical one that the screen had cracked (and not yet time for upgrade) so you could not see who was calling, pictures or text
its a really bad, slow reaction touch screen phone
The phone has great screen resolution, storage is low, you need an SD card to do anything
big screen, thin phone, its light
Phone itself was fine and a good size operating screen
I bought it because I found touch screen phones are a pain in the rear to dial on in the dark and i like the feel of actual keys
I just love the features and the screen size and clarity
Phone looks like new, but it doesn't work like new, there is something wrong with the touch screen, sometimes it freezes, it doesn't respond
Great phone, the company that sold it was nice enough to place a screen protector on it before shipping
touch screen but not a smart phone
The day we received it, we turned the phone on and the screen was purple and black
This phone was purchased for my wife, who made a transition from iphone to Android, and it's quite good as such:it's elegant, right size (not the huge screen of other current phones), fast
The phone is heavier but it's not really a problem it has a stylish look more for a girl than a guyIt has 2 touch screens which is great and this phone is perfect for those ppl who don't have enough patience when it comes to virtual keyboards and if u like the virtual keyboard this has one 2
I am going to be getting a screen protector and a case for this phone later on
Windows Phone 7 doesn't allow you to resize the icons on the home screen, and I had some trouble installing apps, so you'd probably need to upgrade to WP 7
The screen is beautiful and the phone works great, I know its not a 4G device but it suits my needs
love the slide out keyboard and the touch screen
Samsung A927 Flight Ii Touch-screen Qwerty Slider Cell Phone for At&t
The touch screen is nice, and it's super touchy to use
Love the screens and they seem to have the best phone cameras around
disappointed but it is a good phone with nice screen and camera but freezing is bother you everyday
The sound was a lot better than my previous phone and the operation on a touch screen is easy
Found out that the touch screen of the upper part doesn't work, sometimes time phone hangs
i was looking for a phone that was actually responsive when you hit the touch screen
The phone appeared new and worked well for several months, but about 7 months after I bought it the screen started to come away from the casing and randomly would not turn on
Perfect for those like myself who have a hard time with touch screens
Pros* Very nice screen, surpasses any other touch-screen I've used* Very easy to learn the functions included* A lot of customization options included in interface* Uses standard Micro-USB charger* Has X-Box live capabilities* A generous sized screen* Can use internet over WI-FI* Zune music and videoCons* Battery can sometimes only last for 24 hours* If on T-Mobile or other carrier besides AT&T cannot send or receive pictures* Low quality cameraAnother heads up would be that if you want to sign into your current X-Box live account, make sure to use the e-mail linked to that account or else it will set u up with an automatic account and you cant change it unless you proceed with a master reset :( i made that mistake when i first got the phone
The light sensor works and locks the screen when making a phone call but not when putting it in a pocket or purse
Purchased this for an 84yr old grandmother, this phone comes with a huge pink 5-star icon button on the home screen
It's touch screen so it's easy to use -- especially if you like to text
She enjoys the touch screen, the qwerty keyboard for texting, the few apps, and the camera
Seriously the phone started turning off the first day I got it an the screen freezes sometimes
I actually initially bought the phone for myself because I had dropped and cracked my screen on my Galaxy Exhibit so I thought I would find something cheaper, and after searching came across this phone which is nice, but the software is not capatible for the apps that i use so I gave it to my mother
Awesome touch screen it includes an sd slot which is great for when I download all the music I haveThere are no cons to this phone;works perfectly
I have not had my phone 4 months before the touch pad was not working and the screen kept blanking out
The touch screen is a drag
call quailty is better, I can hear the callers better, speaker phone is louder, its still pocketable, screen size is perfect, tad faster (1000mhz verse 600mhz), texting is easier due to larger keyboard, so I make less mistakes, love the address book, can add alot of info on each contact, 16gb of space AND you can add a transflash card
the cell works well, is nice, good camera and an excellent touch screen
Phone still works great, needless to say we got a screen protector and case soon afterwards
A few things I love about this phone: it's really good for texting quickly, great touch screen, and overall quality of the phone
The phone is visually atractive and the screen have a good size
Nothing fancy but nice touch screen which locks easy & prevents butt calling
This phone worked great for a week and then whenever you call its screen goes off and the only way to unlock it to restart the phone or if someone will hang from other side
The screen is very responsive, no lag, the colors are nice and bright, and the camera is pretty good as well
I had promised him one bc he doesn't like the touch screen smart phones, glad I was able to find what he wanted
the screen display, I love it
(I am used to having a plastic bodied phone so this was a great upgrade)-Battery life lasts almost two days and charges very quickly-Beautiful Samsung screen (of course)-Last, but definitely not least, it's CHEAP
I bought two of these as gifts for my brothers who do not love an all touch screen phone
The touch screen works good and the internal memory is enough to have the apps that I need
my first andriod phone was the HTC ARIA I got on amazon, it was good the first week then I started having issues, like locking up texting, had to push hard on the screen, swiping wasn't as smooth and senstive as new
the phone is user friendly, i love the way you can switch between screens, the pictures quality is superb, the phone is sleek and lightweight, i could go on and on
The phone screen has already quit working within one month
I like the phone itself, it is a good first time touch screen users
Menus and the touch screen take a bit of getting used to but it is not a problem
The screen is clear and bright
7 display screen
I figured this out as the screen stopped turning on and pressing near the home button would cause the phone to reset
I had a previous one which was great for texting but touch screen did not work well
Every time I receive a phone call, my screen is black, does not show who is calling
This phone is very good, its performance is excellent, the screen is very sensitive 
The phone is nice but for the screen size had I known it was that small I wouldnt have bought it
Upgraded from a Motorola E2, I wanted a phone that had a replaceable battery and a larger screen
It has a good touch screen and is easy to use
Works great, screen is clear and bright, functions perfectly, and meets my expectations
I already have 2 weeks using this phone and the only thing I can say it's "amazing", very light weight and thin, the resolution/size of the AMOLED display is great, very very good camera, windows 7 mango in gorgeous and very intuitive (it's looks better than any android version that I have used and I haven't had any single "frozen" screen or software lag since I first started it), apps and games are high quality
After that you can send and receive MMSThe picture on this screen is beautiful, the camera has a lot of customization features, the UI is simple and clean I couldn't be happier with this phone at this price point
I like the slide open keyboard and touch screen
An all around great phone, solid design, snappy, and absolutely beautiful screen
I was not getting along with the touch screen of my other phone and I really like the flip and keyboard options
***update*** I received the Focus and it appeared to work perfectly at the time I wrote the original review, but then when we tried to take a picture with the phone a week into owning it, there was a large yellow-discolored area in the center of the screen as if someone tried to take a picture of the sun or something insane like that and burned out the image sensor
My hotmail account was able to be set up as an emaiil app(had problems with the iphone and windows phone) Driod is user friendly and you can arrange applications on different home screens
like the samsung blackjackII cuz its easy to use for me anyway i dont have to deal with the touch screen cell phone((:
It gets caught and is a little hard to open but it's good* touchscreen interface (big screen
browsing the internet on it is amazingly fast and doesnt crash back to the home screen a lot like the iphones have done to me so many times
great for the price touch screen very sensitive but love the key pad letter are larger than my old phone
Great phone, large display for size of screen, however the battery drain is high
