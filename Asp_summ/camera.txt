The camera and video works good for me
(cases are cheap for it too)Cons-No battery access (to be expected with an aluminum phone and not a huge deal, I just always like to have that option)-Both back and front cameras are very grainy and have motion blurring problems, but gets the job done
Really neat phone, love the camera quality
The amoled display is awesome, Its a light weight phone , very good rear camera
The camera on the phone takes great pictures and is one of the reasons I went with this phone
The camera is very good and easy to use
In short, I recomend the phone as it is easy to use and the camera abilities are great but don't pay more than $100 for cause if you are willing to spend more money than get the Galaxy III which I plan on upgrading to when my contract with verizon is up
The camera and video quality is pretty decent with a good set of controls
the camera quality is good and the flash light works great
It has a camera to take pictures and videos, but cannot text or receive videos or photos
The camera takes incredible photos
Bought this for my 66 year-old mother who needs a simple phone to use in an emergency - she said, "It doesn't have a camera
The replacement phone could not receive picture messages, camera didn't work and the volume control was broken
Had trouble with my bank app taking photos of the checks because the camera would not autofocus until I learned to tap anywhere in the field first so they were too fuzzy to record
The camera is really nice too, good pictures
It takes great pictures, although the camera has a small dark spot and everytime I take a picture, there is a small dark spot in every photo, I have learned to live with it since I dont take much pictures
One disappointment was that this version of Android isn't compatible with the Chrome Browser :(The camera actually takes awesome pictures plus it has a FLASH and it ZOOMS
Great camera that takes good pictures
Sorry for the long review but it really is a wonderful cell phoneCons:wonderful big touch screen phone Comes in the package with everything including headphones Great camera
The camera is amazing, takes great quality photos in the day and night
I still love the phone and the 5mp front camera is the best you will find
disappointed but it is a good phone with nice screen and camera but freezing is bother you everyday
The 5 mega-pixel camera takes good pics too
Love the screens and they seem to have the best phone cameras around
I have an android phone, and this one I ordered for my dad, who was looking for something interesting, easy to use and CHEAP, so I ordered the focus, and WOW, now I am hooked with the smooth and nice operating system and excellent pics and videos
Pros* Very nice screen, surpasses any other touch-screen I've used* Very easy to learn the functions included* A lot of customization options included in interface* Uses standard Micro-USB charger* Has X-Box live capabilities* A generous sized screen* Can use internet over WI-FI* Zune music and videoCons* Battery can sometimes only last for 24 hours* If on T-Mobile or other carrier besides AT&T cannot send or receive pictures* Low quality cameraAnother heads up would be that if you want to sign into your current X-Box live account, make sure to use the e-mail linked to that account or else it will set u up with an automatic account and you cant change it unless you proceed with a master reset :( i made that mistake when i first got the phone
Looks nice, fast, expandable memory, the camera takes a decent picture and battery life is quite good
The mango update has added many features, the camera takes great pictures in low light
better than any phone where you have to use the camera light for the same purpose
The screen is very responsive, no lag, the colors are nice and bright, and the camera is pretty good as well
The screen resolutions is awesome, the camera is decent, easy to use, very thin
Fast, great camera with a very good quality of the photo
great camera and easy to use if you prefer an uncomplicated devices as i do
(If you like a good camera phone this phone is a no-go for you)-Speakers on the back
The camera, screen, sound are very good
Also the camera pictures are not good compare to s4
The camera is fairly good too, 16mp and great 1080p video
the cell works well, is nice, good camera and an excellent touch screen
PROS:- films in 4k video ( will not allow you to snap pics while in this mode which is fine )- films in 1080p HD Video for a lower resolution- 16 MP camera with a host of settings ( ISO 100-800 )- Mic is awesome for pod casts or voice journals- Lots of Apps- Screen Resolution amazing (1920x1080) super AmoledNo cons right now
The camera isn't the greatest compared to my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 but it take decent pictures and there's a flash too so the low lit pictures still look good
After that you can send and receive MMSThe picture on this screen is beautiful, the camera has a lot of customization features, the UI is simple and clean I couldn't be happier with this phone at this price point
Everything works great but the camera is very sensitive I get blurry photos very easily
No complaints and the camera and slow mo video is great
I bought this pone over a year ago and I still working perfect, is small, great design, the camera takes great quality pictures for 5MP
The camera is nice and editing feature is great
In general it is OK, menu, camera is pretty good, but low battery and from time to time the phone works too slow
The phone doesn't have flash for the camera
5 GB of ram which isn't really noticeable unless you are heavily multitasking- Camera struggles to focus and stay focused at times but otherwise takes great photos- Runs android Lollipop right now even though Marshmallow is out (I hear they are releasing an update soon)- No active display or LED notificationIt's unfortunate that the market is saturated with phablets and we have very little choice when it comes to conservatively sized devices, but all in all I think this is a great phone (especially for the current price of $264)
Best phone ever the look the quality the performance the speed camera and features on this phone is phenomenal love it I upgraded from a S3
I already have 2 weeks using this phone and the only thing I can say it's "amazing", very light weight and thin, the resolution/size of the AMOLED display is great, very very good camera, windows 7 mango in gorgeous and very intuitive (it's looks better than any android version that I have used and I haven't had any single "frozen" screen or software lag since I first started it), apps and games are high quality
Great, gorgeous looking phone, sharp camera, love the Windows 7 based OS, this one does the job as expected too; highly recommended, at that price, this one is no brainer, just go out and get one
Nice camera with great quality
God knows I'm accident prone,I've dropped this phone so much since I bought it,it works great,nice little camera to,I have uploaded the photos to my computer and the look fantastic,you'd never guess they were taken with this phone
Strong build, good battery life, cameras are pretty good and the screen is all around great
This phone works,looks and feels great and the camera is amazing
