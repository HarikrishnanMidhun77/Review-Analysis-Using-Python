Incredible picture, sound quality at ear piece and speaker phone, very light yet durable, lots of apps and flexibility
The speaker phone is not as load as I would like ti but it does work
I was expecting that the phone would come with a micro sd card the way my first one did from verizon
The phone is pretty much as expected, case is perfect, screen is perfect, its like new but its a phone and therefore i have to be able to actually HEAR people with it in other words the auricular is messed up, i cannot use it unless i put it on speaker phone, big dissapointment
The S6 does not allow you to remove the battery nor add an micro SD card and that us another reason i chise thjs phone
also i managed to use 32 gb micro sd card 
So after researching a lot I found this phone and at a better price than with my carrier so I purchased it, came really fast with my Prime Membership and worked right out of the box, the only thing I had to do was to take it to my carrier because my old phone uses a micro sim card and this is a nano so no problem they gave it to me right away and worked immediately
Unusual features like a micro SD slot and Bluetooth connectivity put it ahead of standard flip phones of the period, and the design is extremely user friendly
For Neg's, I would say the speaker phone could be a tad louder, flash for night time shots would be great and wish I could get a solid 3 days of use, otherwise I keep a charger in the car just incase
I really like this phone seems like it is made really good, I do not have AT&T as my sever I have devote30 for $30 a month unlimited and taxing ,and this phone works grate ,it is a perfect size phone not to big or to small, I like that fact that I can go to another server and use it as long as they take AT&T phones ,,I can here nice and clear,,I just like this red color ,its charges real fast and the battery lasted all day and that evening I was on the phone for over five hours calling everyone and giving out my new number before the battery went dead it did beep to let me know the battery was low, I have no regrets getting this phone thinking of getting another one just so I have it for the future,, in case I brake or lose this one,,I really like the different headset plug in its different then most it's long and flat plug but seems that it will not ware out like the other ones do,,you do need to order the right head sets for AT&T samsung a777,witch Amazon has at a cheep price, witch I did and it works grate or you can buy the adapter,witch I also did so I could use my more expensive head sets on it as well,I also bought the case for this phone and it is well wroth it,
I ended up returning this phone because the speaker did not work
The phone is good, but sound in ear speaker is awful, it flickers on high volume, I tried on low volume but same situation
Before running the phone I charged the battery and installed an additional 8gb micro sd card I got for 19
Phone cames with hands free earphones and travel charger, wich has a usb connector, so you use the same cable to charge device or connect to pc to transfer music, pictures, videos and software updates via ZUNE
I like the phone, but I was disappointed that only the phone charger, battery and user guide was included in the box, I expected this phone to have the micro SD-card,hands-free head set and USB Data Cable included, this is the first time that I bought a phone and it did not include these standard accesories, other than that I like the phone, but I have to now go and purchase these accesories which should have been included with the phone
All the music from my samsung impression SD card transferred with no problemsIt came with a European power adapter but I found out the all my Samsung Impression's accessories are compatible with the 2100 so my car charger, plug-in power adapter and even the headset all work on the 2100
My only problem is that the phone didn't come with a micro sd card
The phone is OK, but I received fake earphones and the charging block didn't work
one thing that has happened is my phone when taking pictures with flash on wiline just turn off by itself and I have to take the entire phone apart and take the battery off just to get it to come back on and Ivery notice that when phone is on speaker phone Noone can hear me while I'm talking other then that the phone is great
I installed a 16 Gb micro SD memory card type 4 and works perfectly
The description says new but the phone came used, when I opened the back to put in my SIM card there was dirt and went inside and smudges all over the speaker and camera lens
)Other high points that I didn't expect, but have come to enjoy:1) FM Radio with the headphones acting as the antenna2) Music player3) SD micro card ready4) Loud speaker (for music and speaker phone)
On speaker and normal use when volume is turned up to max the sound may loose some clarity but I'm sure that one may be related to other background noise and user voice
Other notes:*battery life-it's a smartphone, so don't expect much*speaker-just as loud as, maybe even louder than, my sister's galaxy s3*camera-5 mp not so bad, flash great , image stabilization okay, video quality only good in youtube 720 hd mode*no security lock for apps/text messages, threaded messaging(great feature)*3G connectivityMore updates later***
The phone did come with a charged battery, European charger, North American plug converter, ear-piece & mic, and non-english instruction booklet (Polish I suspect)
The only thing i Don't like that much is the microsd doesnt work as other platforms you have to wipe the phone and you are not supposed to remove the microsd card once installed
The back cover was a little hard to open but once I got it open and installed the battery and micro SD card it sealed up tight with no problems
Nor does the phone package come with a micro-SDHC card which you can purchase on line
I had to buy a data cable at at&t which doesn't seem to be the oem cable but rather a generic micro usb charge cable so I can't update the phone
You only need an micro-SDHC if you want your phone numbers stored separately from the SIM card or if you want to store music to listen to with your ear phones
the speaker phone is loud and clear
