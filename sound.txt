once the mic goes that's it
 No more mic
 I had earbuds that produced a loudness of 93 decibels which made the listening experience mediocre but then I bought buds with a 110 db loudness and the sound is much better
5mm Plug to use for playing the radio through the speaker
 Its a great phone for SMS and rings really loud
Phone works great, looks great and shipped quiet quickly only issue is can with a European Charger so had to purchase micro-usb to usb cable to charge phone which I would have had to do to download and update system any way
A really nice phone, battery life is good for a smart phone, the screen resolution is very good the its light weight, the memory is also expandable with an sd micro card 4g network makes browsing excellent
 However a down side is the app store from microsoft is a little behind the rivals (step up microsoft) overall its a great tool and for the price thumbs up
 Can use huge microSD card
 Looks and works as good as any smartphone on the market with Windows 10 near seamless integration across all Windows 10 OS devices and Microsoft cloud
 Color reproduction is very accurate and movies and other well encoded media looks absolutely amazingInternal Storage is 32GB which should be enough room for apps that will not install to the SD card and you get 26 of that for your useExpandable storage is (currently) limited to the largest micro SD card available 200GBBrowsing: It seems to be pretty good

 Got one for my wife but would have kept iff only microsoft has all the google apps :(
 one aspect i really like is how it easily brings together all my microsoft devices
 Easy , dynamic and quite complete 
" Sure, I could use The Cloud, but I don't want to
 Phone display is impressive, camera is good, battery life good, speaker also okay
I like speaker sound
 It was nerve-wracking to cut the old SIM card (standard size) to the micro SIM size required for this phone, but I watched a couple of videos and took the plunge

 2 drawbacks are: Sound could be louder when playing music from the phone's music app and 2nd, camera could be better
 Apps were enough for video+music, camera, a driving navigator, a walking map, public transit, some Nokia proprietary apps that work well; like the panoramic camera app that stiches together about 4 pictures

Call quality is pretty good though, and it came with a handsfree wired (it doesn't have bluetooth) headset
The SIM tray is easy to use; because it is a tray, not a slot, I was able to insert the micro-SIM from my smartphone without any trouble
 Good sound, plenty loud voice and ringer
 Was unable to dail out you could only talk on the phone with the speaker
 Nokia is out of business/owned by microsoft
 The only reason i give it a 4 star instead of a star is that it charges using a charger that is not a micro USB, which means if you lose your charger or forget it it may be difficult to find another one as i have not seen this type often ( its a small plug) but other than that functions great and is reliable especially if all you want to do is make calls or text
 This phone takes the tiny Nokia barrel connector, it is NOT the common micro USB

 Its design is friendly, ergonomic and intuitive
 The ringtone is loud enough for me to hear from another room in the house but I'm not sure it would be for someone with much hearing loss, and it takes a couple of swipes to get to the menu where the ringtone volume can be turned up
 I can barely hear people when I talk on the phone, but it's not that big of a problem because I have a headset I use or just put it on loudspeaker/make sure I only make phone calls in quiet places

 But it's nice that the USB port and the port for charging battery and for speakers are all on the top of the cell phone and not on the bottom or the side- The Nokia ovi app store is propably the worst thing on this phone
 Low voice volume with incoming calls,which may caused by the earphones
Good reception, good photos, but the headset does not fit well
 First, the bluetooth doesn't work with headsets or your car, it is only for transferring files with Nokia's "Slam" thing
 Also, the only wired headset that works with it is the one that comes with it - a not-too-comfortable Nokia piece
 in addition the phone speaker was very weak that you can barely hear the voice
 It will pair with my cars and show the phonebook but not pass audio or calls through it or even when using a regular bluetooth headset
 Earphones sounds as classic as Nokia always have been, sounds kinda loudy, wich is good when you are on your way to the University or to Work and you don't want to listen anything than your music
 Here's the problem this phone posed for me that make it not workable for my purposes: I do not like to "transfer" my files on the SD micro card; I like to pop it out of the phone, insert it into a thumb USB drive and plug it into my computer to open (I avoid all the registering, logging in here and there, updates that and this, tracking me here and there, and all the other pain in the butt trailer tagging electronic vendors tie to your every move/use
This Nokia phone is lightweight, has great call quality, and has a removable battery (something you don't find in smartphones these days), and a micro sd card slot

 The only problem I have with it, the description says that the phone has a flashlight and radio but does have a flashlight and to use the radio you need a headset, I don't know if is because I received the T-Mobile version or because of the seller
 Otherwise than that, the phone has good battery life, very clear headset speaker and back speaker is pretty loud, screens real bright and clear along with good display of colors

5mm headset will work fine
 I was disappointed with the Samsung - the phone itself was fine, but it used proprietary adaptors limiting my headset options
 I bought 3 Samsung headsets, and all produced too much static for the FM radio to be useful
 The speakers are not that loud enough to notice a incoming call

 It has an extra loud ringer setting and an option for a simultanious ringer/vibration setting which I like best
 My only problem is the battery doesn't stay charged very long and the volumn isn't quite as loud as I would like
It is a good product I had one before I love it, that is why I bougth againg, but this one I got, came break, I have to take to the service to repair, because had trouble the microphone, it is not audible, I can not hear the person who is speaking and the problem is I live in other country

ringer is not loud enough because I work outside on a boat
 When using the speaker phone option you can't initiate speaker until the other party answers which is very annoying
My only complaint is that the microphone suffers from the weird problem that cheap cell phones tend to have - that noises originating from 10-15 feet away from the phone come through much louder than the voice of the person holding the phone

 For this reason, she tends to use her bluetooth headset any time she talks on this phone

 The SGH-T109, which I was still using and still works, also had a very poor headset which I lost
 The replacement headset was even worse
There is no mention of a headset on the Amazon description page but a wired headset is included
 The Nokia wired headset is better than Samsung's with clearer sound
 When using the speaker phone option you can't initiate speaker until the other party answers which is very annoying
 (I had read that some people felt the volume was too low when using the speakerphone
 I think the reason is that the speakerphone does not use the same volume setting as the normal mode
 You have to press the up volume button while you're on the speakerphone in order to increase the volume to a more audible level
 Calendar has a loud irritating alert sound
 after a week I could barely hear sound out of the speaker
works well economical phone
I rated only 4 stars because it's camera and loud speaker needs to be corrected/reformed

Cons:Ringer is not so loud as it could be - can miss a call in noisy environment

 When set on full volume, calls through the handset are uncomfortably loud

 I've only downloaded one new ringtone, (brand-new, not copied from the Sony data card), but it isn't any louder than the ones already on the phone
 I have everything set as loud as it will go, but ringtones are still almost mute
 Oddly enough, the standard tone for calendar alerts is reasonably loud
 I also tried recording loud tones through the Voice Recorder
) Several times now, the phone has "frozen" and begun vibrating and buzzing loudly
 The Go Phone necessitated a new micro sim card
 (Water damaged the in & out mics, but the rest of the phone works
 But it has a micro SD card reader
Comes with US charger, a basic headphone with mic and all the manuals
 Camera is small in MegaPixel but the seamless Panoramic Patch-View mode that stitches together pictures by connecting invisible "floating boxes" works really well
edit 2: I bought "MaGeek® 6ft micro USB to USB Cable High Speed USB 2
+Speaker is fairly loud and better than other basic Nokia's
2MP, also has extra features like panoramic and self-portrait
 Not a big deal, but if you are in the browser or using an application like Google Maps, you cannot activate the loudspeaker unless you exit the application while still in the phone call

I gave the phone 3 stars because I liked the phone's overall quality build and speaker phone volume and ease of use
Something basic and without the bells and whistles that are sheer gimmicks for ego-ridden consumer mania
 but I have to say that the reception and speaker/mic quality was top notch

Don't get too excited about the GPS - it's good in that it works without a data plan but it does take around 5 minutes to load and you do really need a micro SD card to store the maps

 There are 2 charger "ports" on outside, one is USB (the "micro USB" kind) and the one is the round plug which requires the (included) proprietary charger
 "John Smith, Mobile"PROSExcepts up to 8GB microSD RAMSpeed dial number oriented (allows more than one speed-dial number per phone book entry)Works well with Bluetooth: Tested with Bluetooth Headsets Jawbone ICON and Plantronics Discovery 975FOIBLESBattery CoverAs with other evaluations, the back of this phone is (putting it mildly) DIFFICULT to remove once the battery is inserted
 I suspect the battery forcing the cover up along with the unusual hinge angle over the earphone jack as the cause of the difficulty
 I have been successful in carefully prising the cover off the phone: the but-end and then the two sides so they snap loose; then carefully raise the end to unhinge the back from around the earphone jack
 This is similar to my old roaming phone (nokia xpressmusic 5220) which broke down finally ^-^ after 5 yrs of service, so I just removed my micro sd card and sim card from another country and voila
 Speakers are as loud as hell and excellent quality, earphones even better

 This copy isn't very good: the voice isn't good, the speaker isn't working always
Touch screen works well, great sounds, can make pretty high speaker volume on a speaker phone
Although not a "smart phone" this compact device is feature-packed with a camera for stills and video, a real music player, a real FM radio using your headset as its antenna, Bluetooth and USB, and data storage on a mini SD card
As soon as I got the phone, I noticed three items (USB cable, headset & microSD card) were missing

- It comes with a micro SD 8gb (reads up to 16gb cards)11
 The volume range is very good and the stereo speakers work surprisingly well
the touch screen is not as fast as an iPhone, but everything is compensated for all services that does not carry the iPhone, I'm really happy with my purchase and the truth I do not change my Nokia 5800 with iPhone neverThe flash of the camera is really strong,The design is ergonomic and fits comfortably in your hand
 The built-in stereo speakers deliver crystal clear sound
 Nokia also provides a generous 8 GB micro SD card, that can be upgraded to 16 GB
 The phone wouldn't interact properly with hands free headsets, certain menu options were unavailable
What I like about the phone:1/ It is very sleek and fits snugly in the hand2/ The voice quality and the speakers are excellent and have enough power3/ It has WiFi and Bluetooth4/ I am a stylus type of guy and I like the handwriting capability - probably the best feature5/ Changing the SIM or the SD is a snap
 That is easy to overcome, as far as Applications are concerned (you can override him with your voice), but I am yet to figure out how to change the preconceived notions, as far as "Contacts" are concerned - I cannot figure how to create a voice command to call my wife, unless I mimic the Finish guy's ideas as to how to pronounce a name
 The phone works great clear LOUD speaker phone, great fun snap shoot digital camera, great flash abilities to stream web content, great call quality, very pretty screen
 The other problem is the ear piece speaker
 Any phone manufactured before around mid February was probably manufactured with the faulty ear piece speaker
I had upgraded the micro SD card from a 8 gig to a 16 gig
 The 8Gb microSD card it's perfect to store data, music and videos, but if you need more space you can upgrade it with a 16GB card
 Expandable memory (microSDHC 8GB included, can accept larger cards as well)
 Really loud and surprisingly good sounding speakers

 Voice dialing (SIND speaker independent dialing and voice commands)
5mm audio jack where i can connect any speakers to use it as mp3 music player its at top like i pod
and It worht it in every dollarsReciently I added a 16Gb microSD class4 (also I bough it here in Amazon) and it works great
-A lot off apps in Ovi Store-The phone is fast, even with the 16gb microSD
Pros: Good screen resolution, good sound quality, nice headset
 Also upgrade micro Sd 8gb to 16gb and even better, for music, videos, pics, office docs
 the interface with windows programs such as office are no longer useable as the contract between nokia and microsoft is over
 speakers are good quality, and it has 3g
 The call quality is excellent and the speakers are top notch for a phone
 The volume I wished was a tad louder but that is being picky
The graphics on this phone is awesome the speakers are adequate and loud
The graphics on this phone is awesome the speakers are adequate and loud
 one more thing I actually got a cover for the phone and I bought a reasonably priced 16 g microsd card because my 8 gb that the phone came with has 1
 The antenna was in the guise of Nokia's earphones
 Build quality of the earphones was poor though
 Sound quality is great speakers a lil low for me but it must be me going deaf from the system in my car, but this phone is awesome
super long battery life, clean live sound from speakers, easy to use display and on-screen keyboard
The speaker distorts sound if it is set at max but although I would expect better from a phone advertised exclusively as for music, it is typical of almost anything I have had plus I usually have on the earphones so the sound in not on max that makes this mostly a non-issue for me

 Way louder than my Touch and perfect clarity
 I don't even need an additional speaker like I need for my Touch
 The headset comes in 2 pieces with a piece that can control the music and phone, which is very nice
 The Nokia 5800 honestly impressed me, though not so initially, but after a couple weeks of usage it has the tendency to grow on its user offering a solid and sleek feel, gorgeous display, and outstanding audio (the audio is really that good, through speakers and earphones alike, especially with stereo widening enabled, it is truly an experience)

 In viewing the movies on the phone I was impressed at the display quality (16M colors, 640x) and more so with the audio quality - the stereo speakers were loud and rich, able to simulate the acoustic depth of the movie and I must say that it rivals some laptop speakers I have come across

 Super loud
 Music Player is clean and clear but it could be a bit louder
 The micropohone is amazing
 For a phone, the full body sound from its stereo speakers was amazing
 Great for music, and as a speaker-phone
 Impressive loudspeakers on voice calls which is something I find valuable
 Impressive loudspeakers on voice calls which is something I find valuable
 Loundspeakers also work in stereo for music playback
 Both 5800 versions I bought from Amazon, this Xpressmusic version and the Navigation Edition does not come with the proprietary Nokia microsdhc cards
 they came with microsdhc cards rated class 2, and these came with the Nokia-sealed tape, which means they were factory sealed
the only problem that i had with is that the speakers is not that good
when you put a music with some boom boom like hip-hop and the volume is at his maximum it get a lil distortion, its noticible when you put the speakers at max volume
witch is not even a problem, if you want to listen to loud music buy a boom-box
the volume with the headphones on is loud and good
 A minor thing but very important to me was a loud ringer and loud notifications which this phone has
2) Speaker: Sound is so clear and loud
 Probably the loudest I have had
It handles website just as a PC and there is no difference with any websites, I can login to bank accounts and do anything like PC, it has stereo speakers but the Nokia Headsets are far Superior in sound quality and build and it comes with built in Mic and buttons for music track change so we can play music and attend calls without touching phone
 The speakers on this phone are amazing for a cell phone
 The built in speakers are the best I have ever heard coming from mobile phone or any other small device
2 mg camera and video that are fun to use, 8gb of micro SD storage and easy USB connection to your computer for uploading your favorite tunes, which you can use for your ringtones
- Ringtone is loud enough
-Sound is spectacular on the headphones and not too shabby coming from two built in speakers
 and very easy to use hand-free speaker
 Music sounds very good and the external speakers are very good, could be louder, but hey this is a phone not a boombox

 Sync/Transfer files via Bluetooth (Finally you can use bluetooth as it is designed, not just for headset)6
 Brings and 8gb micro SD and I've considered getting a bigger one since the music and multimedia applications are so good :) Still haven't mastered video conversion so I can't opinion on that, but the videos it brought look awesome

If you're looking for an economical unlocked phone with lots of features, I highly recommend the 5800
PROS: Touch function, Screen resolution, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Variety of applications available (including Skype), GPS for free, earbuds, phone speaker, signal strength
I had upgraded the micro SD card from a 8 gig to a 16 gig
 The 8Gb microSD card it's perfect to store data, music and videos, but if you need more space you can upgrade it with a 16GB card
 It automatically makes your alarm tone ascend, which is nice at first, but it keeps ascending for like 5-10 seconds and ends up being REALLY loud
 The speakers are pretty good, the only problem is that it rattles if there's any bass at all in the song
 Storage capacity is also great, especially with the included 4GB micro card
"Express Music" should mean that media is no-problem with this phone, and so far, I am impressed with the overall sound quality of the phone and the included headphones / mic, though the quality of those headphones, and the fit, is a little iffy to me (these are in-ear type, I think I prefer buds)
Call quality has been excellent so far, both for the ear piece and for the speakerphone
 The speaker phone sounds better than my laptop when playing music, more balanced and a a sense of actual bass
 It hold a lot of media in it's external micro-SD card (up to a 16gb microSD now)
 The sound volume is good using it's internal speakers and with both wired and wireless headsets

 Uses a micro sim so you'll need to cut it yourself or get a cutter if you are currently using a standard size sim
 when I open microsoft page on use shop app
On the microsoft store you have to buy everything, the only things free are ridiculous demos

 Easy to use and great loud ringtones
 Clear and loud speaker
 Clear and loud speaker
 she said she couldn't work the speaker part 
 I added a louder ringtone which you can hear down the block
 make sure you don't order a micro or mini-SIM
 Just transferred the SIM card and the micro SD memory card and it works perfectly
 What's better about the Nokia is it's "3G" and can work with our AT&T micro-cell tower at home which vastly improves home reception
We purchased because (1) unlocked, (2) used SIM card, (3) "3G" so we could use our AT&T microcell tower as our home reception is terrible
 The only issue is that the volume on this phone is definitely not loud enough
 I added a 16GB micro SD card to store music on
 If you like the loud and clear sound quality, this phone is for you
 Loud enough speaker but the back faceplate kept falling off every time she picked up her phone
 Ring tone isn't very loud
The handset speaker did not work out of the box
 This little phone does almost everything I want from a phone, tells time on the front little screen (until you have had one that made you open it to see the time you don't know what a convenience the front screen is) calendar, alarms, customizable main screen display, MP3 player, with some know-how and a micro SD card you can get your mp3s to play as ring tones, and great colour
 It does not have a speaker phone as was adverised
- Ringer can get fairly loud (with limitations)
 Obviously, this is an issue with his hearing impairment, but it might be worth keeping in mind that even though the volume of the ringer can get loud, the ringtone may not be in a good frequency
Cumbersome procedure in switching to speaker phone upon placing a call
We purchased because (1) unlocked, (2) used SIM card, (3) "3G" so we could use our AT&T microcell tower as our home reception is terrible
 The only issue is that the volume on this phone is definitely not loud enough
 I added a 16GB micro SD card to store music on
