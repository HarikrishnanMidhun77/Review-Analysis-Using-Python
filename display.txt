 I like the programmable hot keys and on-screen shortcuts
 Having been used to smart phones w/ touch screen, I surprised myself when I worked w/ it easily not having read the instructions to operate it
 I like the keyboard as I am not a fan of touchscreens at all (which is why I didn't get the Asha 303)
 In other words, a good feature phone with smartphone features without the touch screen
 And it's a little bigger, with a wider screen, but not so big it can't fit into my pocket or purse
 which makes it stylish yet classic
This is a good phone although it seems to have a small screen
 Yes, it does have an internet browser which works well, but the screen is quite small so it's not good for recreational browsing
 The screen is sharper, processor faster, phone takes nice clear pictures that are pretty much good enough, the ring and alert tones are more discreet and professional
1 home screen with live tiles and Cortana was excellent
7 inch screen that I had with my Galaxy S3 before switching to the 1520 then to G3
3 inch display, with a resolution of only 800x480
 In our modern age of 1280Ã—720 and above screens that may seem rather paltry
 While using the phone normally it is looks as good as any other screen, but when watching YouTube videos it's lack of pixels becomes apparent
 It is made of a solid polycarbonate body that is very resistant to scratches, with a screen made of Corning Gorilla Glass
 The screen also seems to attract a large number of fingerprints as well, and for some reason is not all that easy to clean off
very easy to use, all the basic things i needed on a simple but trendy touchscreen phone is in this one
 Battery is not big but provides whole day of operation, screen is nice, vivid and bright
 Wonderful screen and light
 Right balance of weight, good screen size, very good battery life
 Great design, really good lcd with Lumia glance screen option which I used to enjoy on my Nokia 925
 The cell phone is ok but the screen resolution isn't high and brilliant as expected
 The screen is awesome and the 5" are enough to satisfied my demands
A really nice phone, battery life is good for a smart phone, the screen resolution is very good the its light weight, the memory is also expandable with an sd micro card 4g network makes browsing excellent
However the phone runs very fluent with W10 and screen is buttery
 Battery is not big but provides whole day of operation, screen is nice, vivid and bright
 The touch screen is incredible
 Wonderful screen and light
Wonderful high resolution touch screen
 The screen is beautiful and the features are out of this world
The screen is absolutely CLEAR and there is nary a pixel to be seen
 but due to small screen size, not much is gained by the higher resolutionCall quality is excellentBattery life: it will make it through the day on a single charge
Wonderful high resolution touch screen
 Huge 5 inch screen
I chose this phone over the old Lumia 920 my wife didn't like it at first, now she absolutely love it just for the size of the screen, it is mush easier to read from and lighter so it's better to use for a long conversation
 Phone display is impressive, camera is good, battery life good, speaker also okay
 It start with photo gallery not responding and then follow by everything disappear from the screen
 Battery, build quality, display, color accuracies are great
 The screen is crisp and clear
 I used as my 2nd telephoneSummary:Pros:+ nice 4" screen same iphone 6+ good response speed in functions+ Most of the needed apps available (watsap, skype, tunein, twitter, etc, )+ with w8
 high hardware at low cost+ same configuration screens as our Windows pc's (for a telephone)+ Accept W10 Mobile+ Good recepetion, speed, functionsCons:- With W10 not working sync with icloud anymore- some not common apps no available (i
 I had a 540 earlier, and moved to the 640 for a larger screen
Fast delivery, received a decent phone, large responsive screen, the battery life is just about right although it takes longer to charge
 The screen resolution is not as high as iphone or samsung, BUT 1- it is not bad at all and 2- due to lower screen resolution, the battery lasts 2-3 days instead of 1 day
The phone fells good in the hand, the screen is really good for the density of pixels it has and the performance so far with games is decent
 If a big screen scares you, then this phone is what you are looking for
After finally giving up on my Moto G4, I bought this which is a small screen display and less specs
After finally giving up on my Moto G4, I bought this which is a small screen display and less specs
 However, I was pleasantly surprised by how clear the screen is outside in the sunlight and how responsive this little 5" display phone reacted
 However, I was pleasantly surprised by how clear the screen is outside in the sunlight and how responsive this little 5" display phone reacted
 This one had a problem with the screen or something else
I like my phone but some apps wont work the same like facebook and messenger you cannot watch live im a teenager so that's important but other than some apps camera works fine fast phone nice screen size beautiful hd viewing
 I broke the screen but it took 10+ drops and a massive plummet to even accomplish that
Plus the screen cracked very easy after the phone was dropped from 3 feet
 Nice having a bigger screen without forking out for a Samsung or Iphone (shows my age im so cheap
 Make sure you get the screen protector for it too though as is easy to scratch the big screen if your a male
 The size is just right for me, the screen is bright and sharp
 Camera quality is not great, but certainly not worse than say the Galaxy Avant or Galaxy SIII Mini, which cost more than this and have far worse and smaller screens

 the phone is stylish
 It's good feature compare to big screen smartphone that leak on charge
 I love the size of the screen and the actual size of the phone
 It has decent processing power, a nice big screen, and a great battery life for a smartphone (3 days
 Beautiful and responsive and big screen
 The screen is bright and the app store isn't bad all and all this one helluva great phone
 The home screen is a little weird to get used too if you are not used to windows 8 on a computer or tablet, but it becomes very handy as you get to choose what you want on the home screen and what you dont want, plus you get to pick from a nice group of colors for your theme
 The 720p screen isn't as bad as people think, everyone thinks its all about pixels, but you can get nice crisp 720p screens, just like this phone has
 With Nokia Black colors on this phone stand out and you get great viewing angles and outside the screen is just as nice, Nokia has done great with there black screen technology
Pros: -Build Quality -Large crisp screen -Windows Phone is a great android alternative, especially since its growing and growing everyday
 It may not be as fast, but the screen size means I really don't need a tablet
 It has always displayed connection problems hence not user-friendly
I got the phone at said time love the big screen but the charger looks so cheap but I don't no if is unlocked because I bought for someone will buy more stuff from this seller and is very heavy phone 
nice big screen, a little too big, but it works great
 Fast, beautiful display, and windows os is great for people who aren't super app dependent
 I love the size of the screen and the actual size of the phone
 It has decent processing power, a nice big screen, and a great battery life for a smartphone (3 days
 Beautiful and responsive and big screen
 Overall he says he is happy with it for its battery life and decent sized screen (an upgrade from his previous phone)
display and sound is good
 I got this for my disabled brother, who will never be able to use anything like a touchscreen phone, and it's perfect
 I can dial a call in way less time than my touchscreen smartphone
 Overall he says he is happy with it for its battery life and decent sized screen (an upgrade from his previous phone)
 On to the phone, it is very light and floppy, you can actually peel off the screen
 I did, the manufacturers used a cheap glue to glue the screen in
 It only uses the standard SMS technology, so I received many texts which the phone told me could not be displayed, and it took me a few weeks to figure out that I had missed some crucial messages
The touchscreen is also not to bad
 The display was not so clean
This phone is totally recommended , basic functions good signal excellent touchscreen applications and light
 Texting is easy, the display is great and easy to see
 Nice screen that you can touch and no need for navigation key
- The internet browser doesn't display most pages in the most ordely way one would expect and you have very little control over the zoom so you either see the pages from too far or you see them way to close, so much that the text sometimes gets compressed in a very thin column- It doesn't display menu options in spanish, despite being international and having, italian, french and portuguese language packages installed
Phone does not work wellThis phone first of all would not be charged with the charger included in the box, now the touchscreen responds at will, it is worst than my broken 5810
I got this phone for my wife and so far she really likes it, it is easy to use, stylish, has many features, very good reception (our provider is att) & the battery life is very good as well
 You can't delete the facebook, store, online games, and other "data" icons, although there is a provision to customize one of the three screens that opens when you swipe the lock screen
 On the plus side, the on-screen qwerty keyboard is good and the capacitive touch screen is exactly like that on an iPod touch once you turn off the vibration-on-touch feature
 It's pretty much impossible to dial this phone inadvertently since the screen locks and can't be unlocked without a deliberate swipe
 The screen itself is extremely tiny, they could have added another half inch in there at least
PROS:-Super Cheap On Data-User friendly-Apps (not many but still)-Capacitive Touchscreen-3
 The screen scratched a little easily though
very satisfied excellent device but the key pad and resistive touch screen takes getting used to
 Touch screen is not that great 
 It is a neat phone, but one thing though you should be able to put the what's app icon on your display screen
 It is a neat phone, but one thing though you should be able to put the what's app icon on your display screen
The touch screen is ok
 Initially I turned off the haptic feedback vibration in hopes to preserve battery, but I found that it helps with navigating the touch screen
 Though the proximity sensor doesn't always work when making a call, so my ear will set off the screen and get a vibration sometimes
Telephone bad, the screen stopped working a week of use
 It survived several falls before that with ease, has a great camera and has both great touchscreen technology and buttons to push
 The nice perk is that I can operate the touchscreen with my gloves on
I bought this Nokia cell phone because I used phones with a number pad before and didn't like using a touchscreen phone
What you have to know about the X3-02:- Its pretty slim and small- They keys are good to write messages, what was the main thing why I need those keys- It has an interchangable memory card- You can use WiFi and download opera mini browser in the app store if you want- You can modify your start screen with a few things like showing your contact favorits, your calendar, notes, time, shortcuts to programs, but nothing special- I would say the call quality is pretty good, at least for me
 Don't know how people hear me- It's nice that you have a little button on the side of your phone to lock your screen
 If you want that nobody has access to your phone then, you need to apply your PIN code to the screen locker
 Don't think just because it has a touchscreen that you can play games you could play on your Android
 Touch screen functions OK
Phone arrived as suggested; the screen resolution is not that good
 The touch screen responsiveness is also not that good
I did like how the buttons felt and the screen was fine, too
 Keep in mind it's the OLD SCHOOL texting kind of set up where you have to scroll through the letters so if you text a little or a lot keep that in mind
 She doesn't like touchscreens
Not So Good:Â° The screen could have been designed with a better resolution
This is a very nice basic phone with extras like great screen graphics, radio and Ineedn't capibility
 The phone is unresponsive and the screen is too small
 The screen cracked at the side after 1 week of use
- Tinny sound (both incoming and outgoing)- No volume toggle (but then, that seems common in these cheaper models)- Feels flimsy- Low-res screenAnd most importantly: NOT compatible with bluetooth earpieces
 It is light but sturdy, looks good, has a good size screen with reasonable resolution and is simple to use
 The phone is unresponsive and the screen is too small
This is a very nice basic phone with extras like great screen graphics, radio and Ineedn't capibility
 Cool minimalist design, keys are tactile and the screen is bright
The phone screen I get broken, was disappointing and aldo no wifi

-Black,blue and grey cellphone-Blue display
 She is more than 60 and she can barely see the screen of most cell phones
 numbers on screen are quite big, and she can listen to the radio on it
Pro-screen is good sizefairly easy to use if you do not have eyesight issuesswitch out mini sim card for easy set up
Negative: to conserve battery the phone shuts off the display until you open it, which means that you can't see the hour or if you have a missed call or a message
 What jumps out at me is the poor screen resolution and weak display
 What jumps out at me is the poor screen resolution and weak display
 The 6133 had a solid display that was easily read for the occasional text message and navigating through the menus
 The 2720 screen is terrible, I can hardly make out anything that is on it and I dread the task of entering contact information
 Another thing is when you want to get back to main screen simply closing phone won't do it
 You have to push end several times to get back to main screen
 The inside and outside displays are bright and clear

I buy the Nokia cell phone to bring to use in Ecuador, but, when I turned on de phone the screen didn{t work
* The call quality is decent, and the screen is bright
 One of the methods the manual offers to conserve battery life is to lower the brightness of the display
 There is NO OPTION ANYWHERE in the display menu or any other area to control the brightness of the screen (and it is bright)
 There is NO OPTION ANYWHERE in the display menu or any other area to control the brightness of the screen (and it is bright)
* There is no way to control the size and layout of the time and date on the main screen
 the screen would stop working after a few drops on the ground
 Bright, high resolution screen (small, however), the GPS map software actually works
liked the phone, but after a week or two the screen went crazy in the middle of a call and I could not see half the screen
 Not sure if it was an unlucky fall, but the screen broke on the inside
 I seems that with this phone, the screen is super sensitive
Can customize where to display contacts from - SIM, phone or both
Screen is very scratchable, buy a screen protector
 My major complaint is what appears to be a hardware issue with the phone that I've read about in other venues since experiencing it: the screen intermittently goes completely white and the phone will not respond to anything
Great battery life, fine call quality, annoying screen resolution and OS
 The screen is nice and the buttons are easy to press
 A straight press of the central Navigation key takes you to the Menu screen
) Â The home screen is divided into four four separate sections for very frequently used items
 Â I use the first section to display the time
 On the next, I display the date, which also shows the next calendar entry, if there is one
 I don't really use it all that often, but learned that this is the only way to easily display how much time is left on the timer when I do need a timer
) If you want to add a new contact, you can only add their number and first and last name from the add contact screen
 In my Sony phone, you just had to highlight a contact name and hit edit which took you to a scroll down menu where you could edit/input info
 This phone is really easy to read, has good bright screen that seems to be scratch resistant so far
 I originally wanted to get her the Nokia Asha 501 because it has Wifi and a touch screen
but AT&T told me that its considered a smartphone BECAUSE it has Wifi and a touch screen
 I like that this is a simple phone (not a "smart" phone, has no touch screen, menus are easy to navigate) but has all the features I need in a phone
 My only real complaint about this phone is that it does not have full-screen photocall (like my old Nokia phone did) and it doesn't let me view photos as organized by folder from the mini SD card (just views them as if they were all in one huge folder unless you specifically save them to individual "albums" and then only view the album that contains the photo you want to view)
 I easily found a nice protective gel cover and clear screen protector film/cover for it on eBay
 The gel cover (bought from "cbcelectronic" on eBay held up great and easily protected the phone from the many times I've dropped it and the screen is still like brand new as well because of the protective film
 I'm not a fan of "smart" phones or phones with touch screen
 It has the same camera, but it has a smaller screen and the 3G is not as fast
 display), closest to my old 6030, and fitting nicely in my existing horizontal belt holster
 display), and a tight fit in my old Krusell holster, the item's Amazon title shows support for both U
On day 1, after working properly for hours, the screen went to white
 The phone randomly rebooted to the white screen again - except this time, I could not get it to turn back on properly
 After doing so, I searched online and found the "white screen" issue is a problem with this model
hey this phone is awesome if you don't want a huge touch screen 2-hour battery-lasting phone that falls and breaks
It's classic Nokia - solid build, clear and logical user interface, real keyboard, good size clear display, camera that's fine for the occasional quick photo and it's affordable
 This won't replace your typical 4-6" touch screen device for video consumption, however it loaded up my 32GB SD card that I use in my other device and played audio tracks within two minutes
 Bust out this 301 and pop onto the Xpress Browser or email your friend on their big screen pocket computer/phone and be prepared to see some shocked faces
Excellent quality, feels like it's made out of top notch materials, and it's very stylish looking
 He said that he had to turn the volume down while using headphones and he said that the lettering on the screen was better than his old phone ( an Alltel SCH-U450 )
Bought this for my brother since he's more comfortable with a physical keyboard than touch screen
 He's very happy now he doesn't need to struggle with the screen every time when the phone ring

 It is simple to use, I love that you can have multiple #s associated with one name, love the touch of the key pad and the bigger display on screen if wanted
It has a larger display than my old nokia so it's easier to see when I'm texting, good battery life, good signal strenght, a decent camera, if you're used to nokia features-they're all there & some seem improved
 The front display is minimalistic, but it does its function perfectly and displays all the needed info (current time or Caller ID info) using a perfectly legible and elegant-looking font
I still love my flip-phone, it has served me well, but now I need a touchscreen so I can text easier
 The screen is small compared to more expensive phones
 The touch screen actions are at times inconsistent (but you learn how to use it)
 You wouldn't want to use it all the time or you would go insane due to the small screen
 It's a well-functioning phone (I like Nokias) with a touchscreen and my sister has one so I could play around with it before buying
This was my second touchscreen phone, and overall it is a great phone
 Dunno if it is just a defect in this phone or a problem with the touchscreen software, but that's why 4 stars instead of 5
Touch screen works well, great sounds, can make pretty high speaker volume on a speaker phone
 I have searched all over the internet and also made sure all the settings are the exact same as the old phone (it had a cracked screen after being dropped)
I've read bad reviews about its touchscreen, but it is not too bad
 The display is not the great and games or any add ons and programs are either non-existent or hard to find
 The sensitivity of the touch screen is not adequate
 Moreover the scrolling is not easy
 It is common while scrolling, you double click on something by mistake
 I bought this phone for my husband because it seemed like the best alternative to an iPhone and similar touchscreen smartphones without the issue of having to pay the ridiculous "Smartphone Plan" fee
 The touch screen is great, the screen size is great
 a note: it's not the same touch-screen technology as most of modern phones use
+ intuitive interface super easy to use+good for a touch-screen beginner (hybrid between traditional and modern selective methods)+superfast camera+nice video quality+decent display+very light and compact, good design+comes with a pick for small objects on the screen (awesome)-not a very responsive touch-screen-image quality is sub-par-no flash ( are u serious

)-maps application is not a good one-on-screen keyboard is painfulBottom line: good for someone who wants a compact easy to use phone without any advanced feature that smart-phones offer
 When the phone arrived I notice there's dust inside the screen, so I suspect it's a rejected one, but the seller sold it to me as a 'brand new' one, I paid for it at a 'brand new price'
 Being a nokia phone user for years, I am well accustomed to the features and interface even with some technological changes (like touch screen)
 I think this is one of the cheaper phones which has touch screen capabilities without having a contract (of 2 years usually) and no data plan required
 wonderful screen
This phone is good, very good even, with a good set of features (Wifi, GPS, good music mgmt, video, etc) and nice touchscreen
 However, don't think that this touchscreen is even close to the iphone's
 If you are looking for something easy to use and your main thing is the touchscreen maybe you should look for another phone
 Nice touch screen, FM radio, GPS, Music player, cable to connect to PC to add Apps and games easily
- The big screen is nice, sensitive and requires zero calibration (not like the Palm TX I used to have some years ago)4
- You have 4 different options for writing, from handwriting, to large full qwerty keyboard in the touch screen9
-The accelerometer works very well on directing the screen for vertical or horizontal display
-The accelerometer works very well on directing the screen for vertical or horizontal display
- I miss the 4 way button from N81 (HTC has one for their touch screen models too) This is especially useful to scroll over long pages such as contact lists, moving among missing calls, or just navigating the internet, where if you touch the screen you can easily activate a link
- I miss the 4 way button from N81 (HTC has one for their touch screen models too) This is especially useful to scroll over long pages such as contact lists, moving among missing calls, or just navigating the internet, where if you touch the screen you can easily activate a link
- Does not come with protective plastic for the screen (the N81 came with an excellent one from factory)7
- I am not into gaming, but the touchscreen games are like for kinder kids, forget about the great engage
 (based on the same Symbian platform as N81)You can press the green call for starting a conversation or you can touch a button in the screen to do the same, so why to duplicate
Overall, I recommend (barely) this cell phone, great reception (although this might depend on your service provider), fantastic sound, fluent Internet experience, excellent extras, outstanding screen and resolution, perfectly calibrated
- In several occasions when you are browsing the web and touch the middle of the screen it closes the browser and disconnects
 The phone is light, fits well in the hand and the touch screen is beautifully clear and responds well with the stylus
When I received the phone I noticed there were 2 tiny scratches on the screen (one was deep), which I couldn't notice until I was outside with the direct sunlight reflecting off the screen
The touchscreen is fantastic, and there are many useful apps available for download
The tactil screen facilitates his managing
 No complaints about thiswonderful product, only (maybe) more MPixels in the Camera and alittle more precision in the touch-screen response
Is one of the cheapest middle-high-range touchscreen smartphones
 Processing power is limited and you will see that when trying to scroll in a webpage
 I love that I can use the touch screen without taking off my gloves or just use my fingernail
-Only 4 shortcuts allowed on home screen, even though there's plenty of room for more
 n the screen cracked while in my pocket
 Speakerphone very good, yes OVI is a nightmare but overall a good quailty and fun phone, touch screen is a little hard but not bad
 The phone was left to charge overnight and by the next morning, there was no display
 I like the touch screen system and the screen resolution is good
 the screen size is nice and large so you can clearly see whats happening
6) if you access the touch screen dialer from main menu- you only get a numeric keypad not an alphanumeric (normal) one
the touch screen is not as fast as an iPhone, but everything is compensated for all services that does not carry the iPhone, I'm really happy with my purchase and the truth I do not change my Nokia 5800 with iPhone neverThe flash of the camera is really strong,The design is ergonomic and fits comfortably in your hand
 Version with Warranty (Black)This is a very good cell phone, it has all the great features one might be looking for, the screen is really large with high resolution
I selected this phone with real GPS, free map, free navigation, touch screen, sliding fingers on screen, 3
 The touch-screen isn't as "cool" as the iPhone, but then again, I am not "stuck" with a data plan
 I have been surprised by the user interface, allowing a touch on things like the clock or the profile setting display to change or display additional info
 Because of this, I was looking for an unlocked, quad-band GSM phone that had 3G, Wifi, GPS, a decent screen size for video and a good app selection
 The screen is on the small side for video, coming in at 3
 The screen is also in 16:9 widescreen format that means that the black bar problem on widescreen movies is not so noticeable
 Touchscreen is good
- The Camera could be better though, and the flash doesn't seem to help, alot of the time sadly-VERY IMPORTANT, the real reason why i didn't give this phone (that I was reaaally excited for) is because the second day I had it, I used the tv- out cable to see some vids, it FROZE and shut off, now SINCE then there is a horizontal line around the bottom of my screen, and it NEVER goes away :'[
 Video webcam available via 2 cameras, not locked on to a monthly $30 data plan like the Iphone, battery on par with my previous cell phones, touch screen is as good as it gets
 It's pretty easy to use for someone who has never had a touch screen before, and even has a help screen in every section plus tip video clips
Touch screen so wimpy,
 Impossibly to scroll down the phone book and stopping by the correct name
 I have owned in order a Ericson from the PCS days, a Panasonic from ATT/Cingular days, Nokia 6120, 6131, Tmobile Dash, Tmobile Shadow, Nokia N95 8GB (for 3 weeks but then the display went out and i got scared to want to replace it so i returned it
 The phone works great clear LOUD speaker phone, great fun snap shoot digital camera, great flash abilities to stream web content, great call quality, very pretty screen
 As for the touch method, the iphone once again is kewler and smooth however the resistive touch screen is CLEARLY improved and does not hold you back
The phone itself is built very solidly for a midrange phone, there's no worry about dropping it and having it break on you, the screen is also very nice, this may not be the slimmest phone out there but it feels very comfortable in your hand, and the resolution looks amazing
Handwriting recognition is my favorite input methods, although the full screen QWERTY comes in a close second
Functionality is very excellent and useful (multiple alarms, wife, touch-screen) but I have twice experienced that after charging overnight, the next day the unit will get very, very warm and will just die
 Upon restarting the phone, the OS would not boot past the Nokia blue welcome screen
 The phone would then just freeze at the screen
Power off your NokiaBefore removing your tiny memory card, take note of the orientation as you are removing it, if you forget RTFM (Read The Find Manual)Power on your NokiaA screen will show up asking if you want to get out of the offline modeSelect "YES", thank God
 I liked so much this cellphone, include beautiful disign, longer battery, widescreen quality and the functionally
 As a media device it features second to none audio quality (with good encoding and headphones it sounds incredible), and a truly amazing screen for photo viewing and video playback
 While it is a little thicker than some other touch screen phones, it is also narrower and has a very nice fit and feel in hand while not being overly bulky in your pocket
 Multiple input options (full screen QWERTY, mini QWERTY, T9 with predictive text, and handwriting recognition)
 The touch screen took some getting used to and I found the interface difficult at first
One other minor negative is that it seems the screen can be scratched easily
3 sreen display quality is good
 you have to scroll by using side scroll bar
 you dont scroll the list from contacts like in i phone
if you have long list of cantacts like 150 and you want to scroll from scrollbar
you are unable to stop on contact you want from scrollbar it run too fast
(long list same scrollbar)
6 screen unlock key is provided at the side of phone
 in i-phone u can unlock phone from screen itself and in samsung touch phones this key is push button key not the sliding key
2 inch screen size
-Amazing screen resolution
-The touchscreen is not the best at all is just resistive but it works better than my old LG Cookie
Pros: Good screen resolution, good sound quality, nice headset
 And although they improved the scrolling tremendously from the software in the device out of the box, it still isn't a good scrolling experience
 There is a great (though limited) app store, awesome mp3 set-up and nice touch screen keyboard
 Touch screen works well
 The phone has great features like wifi, Very good camera (two cameras), touch screen, and many applications
 The touch screen is not bad, but you sometimes have to use the tip of your finger as the area to touch are small
 Once you get the phone you have to update the software or else you will be having weaker scrolling and weaker touch sensitivity
 The screen lock feature is great as it is on the side of the phone
 when the phone rings it cannot be unlocked on the screen that tells you it is locked but rather must use the switch on the side and then tap the answer icon on the screen
The touchscreen keyboard is okay for me (small finger tips) but quite inconvenient for my husband
 The screen rotation is slow sometimes
 you cant go wrong for the price of a touchscreen 3g phone
1) The screen is a pain to use, even with the stylus, screen feels soft, not as sensitive and annoying
 The graphics of these java games remind me of my first ever gameboy and I would prefer to use the gameboy as the on-screen function of the nokia is crap
3) This phone has issues, it freezes at times and you get a solid blue screen, shutting down and a minute later and the phone is fine (happened twice in two weeks)
In the middle of typing, the keyboard screen will momentarily disappear and then reappear
 Whats great about this phone is the touch screen is really user friendly
 I love the thing where it has the icons of your favorite contacts on the home screen (it accomodates for way more than 4 i think i have 7 at the moment
 The screen has good resolution and display, but it could be bigger
 The screen has good resolution and display, but it could be bigger
 Sometimes the screen freezes as you are entering a text message and then picks up by dumping everything you've typed several seconds later
 Again, needs bigger screen and buttons
 The only thing I can think of being a bit negative, is the screen response
 i selected 5800 because it has the biggest screen and is the cheapest
The screen is very bright and nice to look at
 But eReader says they will have one that works on the S60 5th ed with touch screen ability by the end of summer
is an excellent choice if you are looking for a touch screen smart phone, I've had a phew touch screen phones in the past but this is the best one yet, the only thing that I wasn't 100% happy with is the camera is not a very good one when there is not much light, but the rest is fantastic, the different writing modes are the best, you won't even notice it's a touch screen, berceuse you can blast emails and SMS messages like with a keyboard cell phone
Just got this phone and honestly, I prefer this touchscreen over others
Browsing the web though has left a lot to be desired as web pages don't display correctly
I'm pretty sure Nokia will improve the touchscreen sensibility for newer versions, since this aspect is the most relevant con if you compare it with a few competitors that perform greatly in this area
I ordered this because the screen on my original 5800 was cracked
 The touchscreen is very responsive and the vibration when touched is pretty neat also
)8) Calendar events no longer show up on main screen
I loved the way Nokia designed its first mobile touchscreen phone
 Some pics don't display in the browser but the browser that comes with it is pretty well thought out I think updates will come as time goes on and it's rare something doesn't display but it was something i noticed
super long battery life, clean live sound from speakers, easy to use display and on-screen keyboard
super long battery life, clean live sound from speakers, easy to use display and on-screen keyboard
Kinetic scrolling is what most XM users are waiting for in the next upgrade because current dragging scrolling is not as accurate and is inconsistent depending on what app or utility you are using
 The bad news is that the kinetic scrolling will only be for the home screen, contacts, and the browser
 The bad news is that the kinetic scrolling will only be for the home screen, contacts, and the browser
On icon screens the 5800XM requires only a single tap to open but on some of the menus 2 taps are required
The auto-orientation screen rotation sometimes gets discombobulated but corrects itself in a second or so
 Some screens don't rotate but this is addressed in the next release as well according to the Nokia USA discussions forum
Mine and some others have a small open area on the top right side where the top screen section of the phone meets the main phone section
 Dust and even hair can get below the screen
 I love the touch screen
- Touchscreen was responsive and pleasantly easy to use- Price/feature is good compared with other models- Battery life seems to be quite decentCons:- Even though I didn't install much additional applications(nightstand + Opera browser), it kept generating this error "memory card full
Well where should I should I begin, its great touchscreen phone comes with a memory card (8gb)so you can download music and movies if converted to the right format settings
 The screen looks beautiful
 For Example This will be my 3rd cell phone ever my first Nokia 3560 phone without a camera, second LG Cu500 has a camera and music player and 3rd Nokia 5800 Wifi, touchscreen watch and listen to media on the go
 And the touchscreen is a bit hard to use with the fingers like touching an iPhone (I have an iPod Touch so I was waffling between this phone and the iPhone)
 The touchscreen works very well with the included styli though
The screen is gorgeous and so far setting up everything has gone well
I am very pleased with this phone and would recommend it for people who want a quality touchscreen phone and not necessarily an iPhone
 I have had absolutely no problems - no screen freezing and battery life has been very very good
 You can put pics or an icon for people you call frequently (I think up to 5) on the start screen or set up a speed dial number
 I find it easy to use the touch screen but you do need to apply some pressure - more than the iPhone, but it works great
 I love the display and the only thing i don't like too mcuh is the writing panel cuz I like to use the small one and it's a little hard to get every letter straight however the big one is very spacious and nice
 The Nokia 5800 honestly impressed me, though not so initially, but after a couple weeks of usage it has the tendency to grow on its user offering a solid and sleek feel, gorgeous display, and outstanding audio (the audio is really that good, through speakers and earphones alike, especially with stereo widening enabled, it is truly an experience)
 In viewing the movies on the phone I was impressed at the display quality (16M colors, 640x) and more so with the audio quality - the stereo speakers were loud and rich, able to simulate the acoustic depth of the movie and I must say that it rivals some laptop speakers I have come across
 It shines in daylight conditions able to capture great photos and widescreen videos of surprising quality
 In short I chose this phone and adore it now due to its form-factor (not too big, not too small), its screen, its expandability and flexibility, its hardware features (GPS, Wifi, audio) and most of all, its competitive price/quality ratio
2 camera, touchscreen, more customizable than iphone, external memory, etc etc
Regarding the touchscreen
 I never used the iphone, and I think that this touchscreen it is VERY responsive
 Still, it is a very responsible touchscreen (no matter you say that it is a resistive touchscreen)
-The screen it is mega-clear
 It is one of the best screens ive seen
 It is pretty well built, however the screen it is TOO plasticky
 In other words, the screen presents big flex (like in laptops, for instance)
 If you take out the screen part of the cellphone, it is a pretty solid cellphone
-The screen
-Sometimes the phone in landscape mode, when you want to scroll down or up for example in some setting, it is freaking hard
 in vertical mode this doesnt happen, because the scroll bar it is sticked to the right of the screen, so you dont have margin of error

 Amazon On Demand $50 gift certificate - While I don't see myself using the phone to watch movies, this was a nice treat and it looks very sharp on the screen7
 Touch screen is fairly responsive but could use some additional customization for sensitivity5
 It is also very configureable, I can install many apps and the screen is great
Even though this is first Nokia touch-screen experience, it's not bad at all
The PRO's: Great resolution, camera and sound; integrated wi-fi; good memory capacityThe CON's: Poor capacity to arrange the menus as you wish; no easy use of the touch screen as Palm-like graffity
This is my first touchscreen phone, but i'd tried some before, and I really like the way it responds
 The screen resolution is awesome and the aplications works very well
 The touch screen is also nice or should I say tap screen and there are times that it takes a little while before it responds
 It can do more than any other touchscreen phone out there today
The OS is still a tad bit immature, making its crossover to the touchscreen
 There were several occasions when even after getting the soft dialer on the screen, the digits did not send out the tones - on other occasions it did - I was not able to figure out what I was doing differently to get consistent behavior
 The touchscreen is sensitive and is responsive to data input which I didn't expect for a resistive design
 Very fine resolution on the display with saturated colors
I thought it was a reasonable price for a Nokia touch screen phone with WiFi, 3G, GPS, etc
 If you want a touch screen phone, get an Iphone or Droid
 Nice screen in indoor light2
i just got this sweet phone from amazon a couple of weeks ago, and is a very good phone, it has nice features, the image is good, camera is good, touch screen is not as sensitive as the iphone, but is very good also
It's my first 3g phone and I really like it, ease to use, good screen quality but the camera is not good
only a little over 7 months of having the phone, my screen is constantly going out
the phone will be on and flly functional, but the screen will not light up
 I prob wont buy another Nokia touchscreen
 I am not used to touchscreens but getting more and more used to it now
Touchscreen: It has handwriting recognition, stylus and plectrum stylus and you can also use your fingers
 This firmware gives you kinetic scrolling (iphone like scrolling) and a lot of other fixes
 (you will have a hard time with 1-800-CAL-WHAT)iPhone killer: (differences with the iphone)Better CameraBetter Music playersturdierBetter upgrading optionsLower costBetter browserMature OS (with Flash)Support for A2DP bluettoth (clear sound in bluetooth headphones)Better screen ResolutionMore touchscreen inputs (like stylus and handwriting)2 cameras and support for video calls
- The resistive screen is bad
 Don't think iPhone but instead try to imagine a very thin scroll bar on the right side of the screen that you have to target in order to scroll
 Don't think iPhone but instead try to imagine a very thin scroll bar on the right side of the screen that you have to target in order to scroll
 Once it finds one, it has trouble keeping it locked and it seems to have a hard time updating your position on the screen while moving
 On the third week of owning the phone it will not power on,if by chance it powers on it freezes on the initial screen and you have to remove the battery in order to power it off
 The screen scrolls well
 The screen scrolls well
 There is an update to the phone's software that gives it Kinetic scrolling but it's not yet available to North American users even though this is an unlocked phone
Excelent phone for this price I think the best touch screen phone for less than $400 u can found, works perfect in Costa Rican services
So I was a little hesitant to get a nokia touch screen at first because nokia isn't big in the US market as much as it is overseas
 Here are my pros and cons about this phone:Pros:1) Battery Life: I have had many touch screens (instinct, moment, hero, pixi, G1) and of all the phones I have had the battery life lasts sooooo much longer
7) Short cuts on main screen make it really easy to get to contacts you use a lot
 Nice camera, nice sound, good touch screen
 Best feature, no MP3 conversion required, if you have lot of MP3 files on hard disk just drag and drop in few seconds, we can play, phone comes with 8GB of SD Card, can upgrade to 16 GB, that's more than enough, I had used the N95 earlier which costs double this price, this is not a NSeries phone from nokia, but it had all the features + touch screen of N series phone at half the price
And there is software to use the screen as a touch screen mouse for the PC like a wireless Bluetooth mouse and that's free too
 All you have to do is write on the screen and it will type what you write
You can keep 4 contacts (with photo icons) on homescreen for quick calling, texting, etc
 Video and photos are sweet on the lcd screen
 If you like to text and want a full keyboard (or the ability to handwrite using the stylus), keep documents on your phone, (bluetooth is quick and easy transfer back to computer), want to enjoy videos and music (with great sound), like surfing the web, want a GPS (with no need for a data plan), and are a techy-gadget person like myself who couldn't pass up the idea of having a touchscreen, this is an awesome choice
 You can keep your 4 favorite contacts on the main screen
This is my 1st touch screen phone
- Nice big screen (the glare issue could be corrected by buying a stick on anti-glare protection film)- GPS- Wireless connection- FM radio- Easy to transfer data to and from PC- Call quality is good- Expandable memoryCons:- Bad camera for its 3
- Home screen customization is rather limited
 I like its touch screen, resolution is great, the sound is terrific and I can also watch videos from youtube
-Great colors and touch screen response
-Battery is kind of lacking but what touch screen isn't
 Most responsive touch screen that I have used
I got this Phone 2 weeks ago, I like it because it is very firm in hand, touch screen, and have wifi
 The touch screen is very good , as I never used an Iphone, but the sensor is good enough for you to use your finger on it
 You can save your favorite 4 phone number on the home screen and creat button with an image icon
I like this feature, because I can put my family members phone number on the home screen
 some time it frozen the screen, you have to restart the phone to make it work
This is a really good phone for all of those people looking for a cheaper option for a good touchscreen smartphone
 This is my first touchscreen phone so I can't really judge too much the keypad but it has full qwerty and I've found it a bit of a challenge to get used to
 Being a nokia phone user for years, I am well accustomed to the features and interface even with some technological changes (like touch screen)
 I think this is one of the cheaper phones which has touch screen capabilities without having a contract (of 2 years usually) and no data plan required
 wonderful screen
This phone is good, very good even, with a good set of features (Wifi, GPS, good music mgmt, video, etc) and nice touchscreen
 However, don't think that this touchscreen is even close to the iphone's
 If you are looking for something easy to use and your main thing is the touchscreen maybe you should look for another phone
 Nice touch screen, FM radio, GPS, Music player, cable to connect to PC to add Apps and games easily
- The big screen is nice, sensitive and requires zero calibration (not like the Palm TX I used to have some years ago)4
- You have 4 different options for writing, from handwriting, to large full qwerty keyboard in the touch screen9
-The accelerometer works very well on directing the screen for vertical or horizontal display
-The accelerometer works very well on directing the screen for vertical or horizontal display
- I miss the 4 way button from N81 (HTC has one for their touch screen models too) This is especially useful to scroll over long pages such as contact lists, moving among missing calls, or just navigating the internet, where if you touch the screen you can easily activate a link
- I miss the 4 way button from N81 (HTC has one for their touch screen models too) This is especially useful to scroll over long pages such as contact lists, moving among missing calls, or just navigating the internet, where if you touch the screen you can easily activate a link
- Does not come with protective plastic for the screen (the N81 came with an excellent one from factory)7
- I am not into gaming, but the touchscreen games are like for kinder kids, forget about the great engage
 (based on the same Symbian platform as N81)You can press the green call for starting a conversation or you can touch a button in the screen to do the same, so why to duplicate
Overall, I recommend (barely) this cell phone, great reception (although this might depend on your service provider), fantastic sound, fluent Internet experience, excellent extras, outstanding screen and resolution, perfectly calibrated
- In several occasions when you are browsing the web and touch the middle of the screen it closes the browser and disconnects
 The phone is light, fits well in the hand and the touch screen is beautifully clear and responds well with the stylus
When I received the phone I noticed there were 2 tiny scratches on the screen (one was deep), which I couldn't notice until I was outside with the direct sunlight reflecting off the screen
The touchscreen is fantastic, and there are many useful apps available for download
 The phone was left to charge overnight and by the next morning, there was no display
 I like the touch screen system and the screen resolution is good
 the screen size is nice and large so you can clearly see whats happening
6) if you access the touch screen dialer from main menu- you only get a numeric keypad not an alphanumeric (normal) one
the touch screen is not as fast as an iPhone, but everything is compensated for all services that does not carry the iPhone, I'm really happy with my purchase and the truth I do not change my Nokia 5800 with iPhone neverThe flash of the camera is really strong,The design is ergonomic and fits comfortably in your hand
 Version with Warranty (Black)This is a very good cell phone, it has all the great features one might be looking for, the screen is really large with high resolution
I selected this phone with real GPS, free map, free navigation, touch screen, sliding fingers on screen, 3
I bought this cell phone because it looked amazing online and was packed with some great features like the touch screen, 3G support, wifi, 3
 When I switched on the phone I felt that the screen was too cluttered with icons, the touch screen was not too responsive and the interface was not user friendly
 I keep a Nokia N75 for backup but it was driving me crazy thinking I would have to use it for weeks; I use my phone way too much and have become quite addicted to the touch screen
 The camera is great and takes good pictures, the screen is gorgeous and looks nice when surfing the web
 The touch screen is not as sensitive as an iPod / iPhone when you use fingers, however with the provided stylus it is comparable
 Other than the home screen widgets, it's running essentially the same version of S60 5th Edition
I'm using it with a mobile company in Mexico and as soon as I turned it on, it got the signal, the screen is a neat widescreen (but very fragile, so be ready to buy a screen protector),I totally recommend you the phone and Amazon deals
The Nokia 5800 is a good phone but has its downsides:Pros:- Touch screen is responsive- The full keyboard is spacious- Has a stylus but isn't really needed- Feels sturdy- Comes with 8GB of storage- Decent camera for a cell phone,- Internet browsing is decent- Comes with Wifi and Bluetooth- Good music player/radioCons:- The memory card is very hard to remove
Many times the screen will freeze and the only way to get the phone working agin is to remove the battery
One of my best cellphone that I hadCamera okTouchscreen very intuitiveSoftware fineand Hardware perfect
 The display is ok but if you compare with iphone4 retina display, this phone stays at bottom
Functionality is very excellent and useful (multiple alarms, wife, touch-screen) but I have twice experienced that after charging overnight, the next day the unit will get very, very warm and will just die
 Upon restarting the phone, the OS would not boot past the Nokia blue welcome screen
 The phone would then just freeze at the screen
Power off your NokiaBefore removing your tiny memory card, take note of the orientation as you are removing it, if you forget RTFM (Read The Find Manual)Power on your NokiaA screen will show up asking if you want to get out of the offline modeSelect "YES", thank God
 I liked so much this cellphone, include beautiful disign, longer battery, widescreen quality and the functionally
 The display sort of looks like a wanna be iphone, and it responds fairly well to commands
I have had to send mine in for service twice since I bought it, the first time for them to tighten the seams around when the phone locks and unlocks (it is a little switch that you push up to lock or unlock, which I find annoying and looks like it might break if you accidently push it too hard) which were coming loose, and the second time because my screen went black
The Bad-The phone is a fingerprint magnet and you will be constantly wiping-The screen is sort of plasticity feeling and not as nice as other touch screens-The phone is too thick, and if you get a cover(which you do need) it gets even thicker-The stylus is annoying and is easily lost-The graphics mess-up and freeze all the time, sometimes distort and you have to lock and unlock, or even reset in extreme cases, to fix them-Every couple of months the phone will get stuck and vibrate uncontrollably, you'll need to reset it to fix-It can sometimes get confused with orientation and won't known whether to be vertical or horizontal when you text-The setting take a little while to figure outThe Good-The phone is the nicest touch phone you'll find at such a low price-The customer service is helpful-It is very resilient for a touch phone and has withstood many falls and bangs (in part thanks to the case)-It seems like it will last you a couple years-It's a nice phone for someone on a budget who wants to get something a little nicer than a basic phone-You can browse the internet-You can download some apps and different features-I have never seen anyone else with the same phone at least here in Florida, and it seems to be a little more uncommon in the US, so you'll probably be the only person you know that owns one (which can be a good or a bad thing I guess)In conclusionIf you want a nice not too expensive touch phone, with some web capability get this phone, but if you're looking for and iphone or Android substitute look elsewhere
 Tough screen very irritating, have to struggle to find a contact, poor signals, freezes frequently
 Phone came back with a new damaged screen and I've been jumping through hoops for almost two weeks now trying to get it repaired
The screen started cracking after less than 3 weeks of usage
 Browsing the internet isn't that smooth because the 5800's touch-screen is either overly sensitive sometimes or it just takes a slegdehammer to register an input
 The switching function between horizontal and vertical screen is eratic and seems to switch to horizontal when I want it vertical and vertical when I need it horizontal, so I just turn off the auto-turn feature
 The screen responds well to me, and software updates have improved over time
 After that time, I have had to either turn off+turn back on the phone or blindly touch the right section of the screen to access the web browser for the screen to start working properly again
 Jacked up screen and all, I still use my 5800 daily as an mp3 player - and of course as a cell-phone
I got this phone because I wanted an unlocked phone with a touch screen and QWERTY keyboard
I watched some reviews on youtube before I bought this and I was a little worried about getting it because in the videos, there seemed to be a big lag between when they pushed a button and when something opened, or when they flipped the phone it would turn black for a couple seconds before flipping the screen
 Also, they were having problems getting some of the buttons to work, especially the xpressmusic button above the screen
 But, I haven't had any problems at all with any of the buttons and there is a slight lag when flipping the screen, but it's usually less than a second, so it's not really a problem at all
I like the xpressmusic button above the screen and the 4 favorite contacts on the main screen
 There is also a (tiny) clock/alarm button on the top right corner of the screen, so you can set your alarm clock pretty quickly
 The screen is black and text is white, so that's easier on your eyes if you're in a dark room too
 I put some pictures I have taken with my other camera on the memory card and they look great on the screen and are really clear
Pros:xpressmusic buttonFavorite contactsPretty good pictures and video (sometimes)Really nice screen for viewing photos/videosQWERTY keyboardTouch screen feels/works greatMusic playerMusic tones8GB cardCons:No delete all button for texts and contactsAlarm clock settingsUPDATE: I did end up finding how to change the settings on the alarm clock to turn vibrate off
Also, since other people have said that they don't like the touch screen, just saying that I really like it
 I've tried a couple of my brother's phones and his are harder to control with scrolling, swiping, and accidently clicking things
 The touch screen on this is a lot easier to handle and you can change the settings to adjust the intensity of the slight vibrate that it does when you push buttons
 Overall, it works great and, even though this is my first touch-screen phone, I find it intuitive enough to easily figure out what I want to do
 Processing power is limited and you will see that when trying to scroll in a webpage
 I love that I can use the touch screen without taking off my gloves or just use my fingernail
-Only 4 shortcuts allowed on home screen, even though there's plenty of room for more
 n the screen cracked while in my pocket
 Speakerphone very good, yes OVI is a nightmare but overall a good quailty and fun phone, touch screen is a little hard but not bad
The tactil screen facilitates his managing
 No complaints about thiswonderful product, only (maybe) more MPixels in the Camera and alittle more precision in the touch-screen response
Is one of the cheapest middle-high-range touchscreen smartphones
 Texting is also a breeze - just use the on-screen QWERTY keyboard for SMS or Email messages
 I have a month with him and has not given me any problems, I like the touch screen, good sound, the memory of everything you want to save
 The touch screen is responsive, and if you can't get it done with your stubby fingers, the included stylus does the trick
 The screen is about big enough, and fonts can be enlarged for readability
 Otherwise, I find that I probably wouldn't get much done at all without the stylus (just not enough screen real-estate to really handle today's typical sites)
 I do find that the auto-rotation of the screen gets worse when multiple apps are running (fails to rotate), but if one tips it right (think, parallel to the floor
 This was key for me, since I've used different touch screens and qwerty keyboards and often just can't do it with my blunt fingers
 My only issue with the Nokia is that the full-screen qwerty touch does not put some common symbols on the primary screen, symbols like @ for emails or ) for smiley faces (hey I like to be friendly)
The latest symbian update allows a seemingly infinite number of contacts on the home screen (previous was 4 - yuck), and did link to my primary emails without a hitch, and I can manually update to read them when I think I want to
 I especially like that the contacts on the home screen are 'tracked' - I can see texts for example, that I've exchanged with just that one person, and send a new one
)Well executed touch screen / stylus back-uplots of free and useful apps / wallpapers / you name it
 The screen is gorgeous and watching movies on it is a blast
 The touchscreen is smooth, both the touchscreen and soft keypad are very responsive
The screen of the 5800 while not distorted as intimated in a previous review, is slightly wavy, but not in any way unpleasant to view
 What I do find to be a screen problem is its tendency to be a fingerprint magnet
 I spend a lot of time wiping the screen on my shirt to get rid of the latent fingerprints
 I have the same fingerprint problem with my Compaq 931 laptop, but I don't get fingerprints on its screen as often as with the 5800
 The 5800 does have an auto-shutdown feature which shuts off the screen and asks you to push the unlock lever on the side to restore the screen
 The problem with the auto-shut off feature appears to be, that the screen goes off as it should, but if I leave the camera function on and then while the screen shuts down, it does not shut down the camera and the battery continues to be depleted as if the screen was on and I was using the camera
 I loved the camera, the touch screen, the long battery life, and even the qwerty keyboard
 If I ever had the screen unlocked, the phone opened either my call log or contacts and dialed the first number on the list without even being touched
 One night when I forgot to lock the screen, I overslept because my phone alarm didn't go off-- the phone (which had previously been good for 6 days without recharging) had died because it called my best friend 42 times that night and left 4 long voicemails while I was asleep
 Not to mention, if I ever had the screen unlocked while I made a legitimate call, it would often put the person I was talking to on hold, open the call log, and attempt to call that person again
I sent it back to Nokia after attempting several factory resets and software upgrades (which was a task in itself because I had to have the screen unlocked-- which caused problems as mentioned above)
- The Camera could be better though, and the flash doesn't seem to help, alot of the time sadly-VERY IMPORTANT, the real reason why i didn't give this phone (that I was reaaally excited for) is because the second day I had it, I used the tv- out cable to see some vids, it FROZE and shut off, now SINCE then there is a horizontal line around the bottom of my screen, and it NEVER goes away :'[
 Video webcam available via 2 cameras, not locked on to a monthly $30 data plan like the Iphone, battery on par with my previous cell phones, touch screen is as good as it gets
 It's pretty easy to use for someone who has never had a touch screen before, and even has a help screen in every section plus tip video clips
Touch screen so wimpy,
 Impossibly to scroll down the phone book and stopping by the correct name
 I have owned in order a Ericson from the PCS days, a Panasonic from ATT/Cingular days, Nokia 6120, 6131, Tmobile Dash, Tmobile Shadow, Nokia N95 8GB (for 3 weeks but then the display went out and i got scared to want to replace it so i returned it
 The phone works great clear LOUD speaker phone, great fun snap shoot digital camera, great flash abilities to stream web content, great call quality, very pretty screen
 As for the touch method, the iphone once again is kewler and smooth however the resistive touch screen is CLEARLY improved and does not hold you back
The phone itself is built very solidly for a midrange phone, there's no worry about dropping it and having it break on you, the screen is also very nice, this may not be the slimmest phone out there but it feels very comfortable in your hand, and the resolution looks amazing
Handwriting recognition is my favorite input methods, although the full screen QWERTY comes in a close second
 The touch-screen isn't as "cool" as the iPhone, but then again, I am not "stuck" with a data plan
 I have been surprised by the user interface, allowing a touch on things like the clock or the profile setting display to change or display additional info
 Because of this, I was looking for an unlocked, quad-band GSM phone that had 3G, Wifi, GPS, a decent screen size for video and a good app selection
 The screen is on the small side for video, coming in at 3
 The screen is also in 16:9 widescreen format that means that the black bar problem on widescreen movies is not so noticeable
 Touchscreen is good
 I laugh all the time because I remember when these types of cell phones (that didn't have a colored screen) were the "it" phones back in my days, lol
 I'm keeping my propel for how stylish it is
 The screen is sharp and contrast is great
 Also the on screen keyboard is a little smaller than I would have liked
 The screen is a bit smaller
Use of phone is like button setting, but touch screen
This phone is a nice device for someone who is looking for a basic 3G phone (for voice, text, access the web with Opera Mini, and viewing Office documents on the move) with a touch screen
 Most of the time when I try to Long Press the HOME button to get to the task switching screen, I get something else
 The screen started fading
 It is ver sensitive to the touch and the screen is so small you can accidently touch multiple applicatin you never intended to
 The screen is sharp and contrast is great
 Also the on screen keyboard is a little smaller than I would have liked
wouldn't you know it, the liquid screen went on my phone
 They told me ALL parts are covered under my warranty EXCEPT the liquid screen
 Over all I totally recommend this phone to anyone who doesn't like advanced touch screen phones or those smart phones, this phone is perfect for someone who just wants it for taking pictures and talking on the cell phone for constant communication
display went out, phone is not that old , junk, dont buy this phone you will not like it when it stops working
 The display, while dated, is more that adequate
 Good visual screen
 The screen, however, is small for internet use, but it allows connection for email through various providers
 It takes photos, and records like a camcorder, this includes self timer, image sequence, brightness control, effects, whitness balance, and video share call16-There is a screen on the outside so you can see who is calling without opening the phoneAppearance1-Menu functions are easy to see
 The flip design and the outside screen continues to be very modern and practical
 The display on the front (shown here) went out on my original phone
 It's small, easy to use and stylish
 She had this phone for quite some time before and the screen on her old phone just went blank
95/mo to display the city matching the area code of an incoming call
 The phone powered up and displayed the T-Mobile information
 Starting with the organized feel, splash screen, the way contacts are grouped and topping with the batter life which is just lousy, this phone just doesn't feel like a Nokia phone
I can't remember the exact wording of the message displayed, but I looked on the Internet and found the message meant the phone was still locked
Had another brand with a touch screen that didn't work well
 If you touched the phone, not even the screen, it would disconnect the incoming call
 Slightest movement would make the phone do who knows what even with the touchscreen locked
 Gave up on touchscreens after the manufacturer of that phone replace the original and still had the same problem
 The only thing I don't like on this phone is the inability to delete unused icons from the menu screen, or to put icon shortcuts on the screen that you do use
 Have to open an icon (My Stuff) then scroll to a menu item (Tools) then scroll to Recent Calls to see who called you when you were unavailable
 Would be nice to have that menu item as an icon on the main screen
Only issues is that the phone lacks an attachment point for a leash, a major pain for anyone keeping it in a purse or bag and the second display has few personalization options
I wanted a flip phone after having problems with other touch screen types of cell phones
 Just like me she had a hard time using the touch screen, this phone is perfect
 My husband and I looked at the new iPhone but I could barely read the fine print on the small screen
 This little phone does almost everything I want from a phone, tells time on the front little screen (until you have had one that made you open it to see the time you don't know what a convenience the front screen is) calendar, alarms, customizable main screen display, MP3 player, with some know-how and a micro SD card you can get your mp3s to play as ring tones, and great colour

 The front display does not show the date, and takes so long to load the time that it is actually quicker to pull the phone completely out of my holder and flip open to see the time
 Something irritating, getting stuck in a screen that says AT&T Navigator, put in your 10 digit number and getting stuck there
The screen went bad shortly after we started using it
- the numbers on the buttons and the screen are fairly easy to see
Cons:- The written text/letters on the screen are fairly small
the external screen gave up the ghost
 The flip design and the outside screen continues to be very modern and practical
 Too bad because I like the simple model, the screen is easy to read and I can carry it in my pocket
